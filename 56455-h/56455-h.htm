<h3>
I
<br />
JIM CONNOR
</h3>

<p>
"Nope, promised to be home on time for
supper."
</p>

<p>
"Get panned last night!"
</p>

<p>
"Yep."
</p>

<p>
The group of men turned to the clock which
was ticking high up on the wall between the
smudgy painting of Leda and The Swan and
the framed group photograph of famous
pugilists from Paddy Ryan to the present day.
</p>

<p>
"It's only nineteen past; plenty time for
just one more."
</p>

<p>
Jim Connor compared his watch with the
clock and found they tallied.  The grave
bartender took the dice and box from behind the
cigar counter and courteously placed them
upon the bar.
</p>

<p>
"Well," bargained Jim, "if it <i>is</i> just one
more."
</p>

<p>
"J.O.M." they chorused, and the dice
rolled upon the polished oak.
</p>

<p>
"What'll it be, gents?"
</p>

<p>
"Beer."
</p>

<p>
"Scotch high."
</p>

<p>
"Bourbon."
</p>

<p>
"A small beer, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"Beer."
</p>

<p>
"Yours, Jim?" prompted the watchful bartender.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;I guess you can give me a cigar
this time, Jack."
</p>

<p>
The practiced bartender, standing by his
beer pump, slid the whisky glasses along the
slippery counter with a delicate touch, as a
skillful dealer distributes cards.  He set out
the red and smoky whiskies, the charged
water, the tumbler, with its cube of ice; drew
two glasses of beer, scraped the top foam
into the copper runway, and almost simultaneously,
as if he had four hands, laid three
open cigar boxes before Jim, who selected a
dark "Joe Tinker."
</p>

<p>
"Join us, Jack," invited the loser of the
dice game, hospitably waving his hand.  The
efficient bartender drew a small half-glass of
lithia for himself.  Five feet rested upon the
comfortable rail before the bar, there was the
little pause imposed by etiquette, six glasses
were raised to eye-level.
</p>

<p>
"Here's whatever."
</p>

<p>
"Happy days."
</p>

<p>
"S'looking at you," ran the murmur.
</p>

<p>
"The big fellow!" exclaimed one.
</p>

<p>
Chorus: "Yes, the big fellow!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll sure have to come in on that," said
Jim, pressing between two shoulders to the
bar.  "A little bourbon, Jack," he asked
briskly.
</p>

<p>
The other glasses were lowered until Jim
also received his.
</p>

<p>
Then all were again raised to eye-level.
Unanimously, "The big fellow!"
</p>

<p>
Heads were thrown back and each ego
there, except the bartender, received a
charming little thrill.
</p>

<p>
The beer men wandered to the back of the
saloon and dipped into a large pink
hemisphere of cheese.  The whisky men
suppressed coughs.  Jim tipped his head back
about five degrees and inquired, "Is the big
fellow coming 'round to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"He's due," replied Jack, wiping his bar
dry again.
</p>

<p>
"How's things looking to you?"
</p>

<p>
"We&mdash;ell, there's always a lot of knockers
about."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, 'pikers' like Ben Birch and Coffey
Neal, that line up with the big fellow for ten
years and then throw him overnight because
he won't let 'em name the alderman this time.
And he always treated 'em right.  Better
than me.  An' jou ever hear me kicking?"
</p>

<p>
"Nary once, Jim."
</p>

<p>
"That's because I am a white man with
my friends.  But these other Indians&mdash;well,"
said Jim earnestly, "God knows ingratitude
gets my goat."
</p>

<p>
Jim Connor was a ward heeler and the
big fellow was his ward boss.  Jim was
allowed to handle some of the money in his
precinct at primaries and elections; he landed on
the public pay-roll now and then; he was
expected to attend funerals, bowling matches,
saloons, picnics, cigar shops and secret
society meetings throughout the year; his
influence lay in his strength with the big fellow.
Did a storekeeper want an awning over the
sidewalk, or did he not want vigorous building
inspection, if he lived in Jim's precinct,
he told Jim, and Jim told the big fellow, and
the big fellow told the alderman, and the
alderman arranged it with his colleagues on
a basis of friendship.  In return, the
storekeeper voted with the organization, which
was the big fellow, who was thus enabled
always to nominate and usually to elect
candidates who would do what he told them.
He told them to line up with the interests
who had subscribed to the campaign fund&mdash;and
he was the campaign fund.  The entire
process is pretty well known nowadays
through the efforts of Mr. Lincoln Steffens
and his associate muckrakers.
</p>

<p>
But there is no immediate cause for alarm;
this is not a political novel.
</p>

<p>
The clock pointed nearly to seven and Jim,
when he saw it, sighed.  That meant
unpleasantness.  His supper certainly would be
cold, but he wasn't thinking of that.  He was
thinking of his wife.  She was sure to make
him uncomfortable in some way or other,
because he had broken his promise about
being home on time.  Probably she would be
silent.  If there was anything he hated, it was
one of her silent spells.  Just "No" and
"Yes," and when he asked her what in hell
was the matter, she would say "Nothing."
</p>

<p>
The trouble was, though, that he always
knew what the matter was, even when she
said "Nothing."  What devil's power was
there in wives, anyway, that enabled them
to hurt by merely not speaking?  He had tried
silences on her a lot of times, but they never
worked, not once.  He liked the old days
better, when she used to scold and plead and weep.
</p>

<p>
He remembered the first time he had come
home drunk, half a dozen years ago, when he
had barely turned from bridegroom to
husband.  She helped him that night to undress
and to go to bed.  And she had done other
things for him, too, that even now he was
ashamed to remember.  And the next day she
hadn't scolded once, but had fetched him a
cup of coffee in bed as soon as he woke up.
It surprised him; overwhelmed him.  It had
made him very humble.  He had never been
so repentant before or since.
</p>

<p>
She didn't reproach him that time&mdash;not a
word.  He didn't mean she had one of her
silences&mdash;those didn't begin until much later;
but she tried to talk about their usual affairs,
as if nothing had happened.  And everything
had happened.  They both knew that.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't until the next evening, thirty-six
hours later, that he came home to find her
a miserable heap upon the front room sofa,
her face buried.  He stood in the middle of
the room looking at her helplessly, his words
of greeting cut short.  Every now and then
her small shoulders heaved up and he heard
her sob.  She must have been crying a long
time.  He implored her, "Oh, don't, Georgia,
don't; please don't; won't you please not?"
</p>

<p>
After a little while she stood up and put
her arms about him and kissed him.  He had
never had such a feeling for her, it seemed
to him, not even when they walked down the
aisle together and she leaned on him so
heavily.  And then he kissed her solemnly,
in a different way than ever before.  He took
the pledge that night, and he kept it, too, for
a long time, nearly a year.  That was the
happy time of his life.
</p>

<p>
When he did begin again, it was gradually.
She knew, after a time, he wasn't teetotal
any more, and she didn't seem to mind so
much.  He remembered they talked about it.
He explained that he could drink moderately,
that she could trust him now, and mustn't
ever be afraid of any more&mdash;accidents.  And
that very same night he came home drunk.
</p>

<p>
She cried again, but it wasn't as solemn
and as terrible for either of them as the time
before.
</p>

<p>
There had been other times since, many of
them.  And she had grown so cursedly
contemptuous and cold.  Well&mdash;he didn't know
that it was altogether his fault.  He had
heard that alcoholism was a disease.  But
she had said it was a curable disease, and
if he couldn't cure it, he had better die.  His
own wife had told him that.  God knows he
had tried to cure it.  He had put every pound
he had into the fight; not once, but a hundred
times.  He had gone to Father Hervey and
taken the pledge last Easter Day, and&mdash;here
he was with a whiskey glass in his hand.
</p>

<p>
He looked across into the high bar mirror.
His eyes were yellow and his cheeks seemed
to sag down.  He put his hand to them to
touch their flaccidity.  His hair was thinning,
there were red patches about his jaws where
veins had broken, and his mouth seemed
loose and ill-defined under the mustache
which he wore to conceal it.  He frowned
fiercely, thrust his chin forward and gritted
his teeth tightly to make of himself the
reflection of a strong man&mdash;one who could
domineer, like the big fellow.  But it was no
use&mdash;the mirror gave him back his lie.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon rush was over, the evening
trade had not begun, and the saloon was
empty, save for a group of scat-players at the
farther end.
</p>

<p>
Jim's friends had gone, but he remained
behind, in gloomy self-commiseration, his
shoulders propped against the partition
which marked off the cigar stand.  He was
thinking over his troubles, which was his
commonest way of handling them.
</p>

<p>
Whoever it was that invented the saying,
"Life is just one damned thing after
another"&mdash;he knew, he knew.  Jim had bought
three or four post-cards variously framing
the sentiment and placed them upon his
bureau, side by side, for Georgia to see.  It
was his criticism of life.
</p>

<p>
You politicians and publicists, if you want
to know what the public wants, linger at the
rack in your corner drug store and look over
the saws and sayings on the post-cards.
</p>

<p>
Jim hoped that the ones he had picked out
would subtly convey to his wife that all were
adrift together upon a most perplexing
journey and that it ill-behooved any of them
to&mdash;well there was a post-card poem that just
about hit it off&mdash;and he put it on the bureau
with the others:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "THERE IS SO MUCH BAD IN THE BEST OF US<br />
  AND SO MUCH GOOD IN THE WORST OF US,<br />
  THAT IT HARDLY BEHOOVES ANY OF US<br />
  TO TALK ABOUT THE REST OF US."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But she hadn't taken the least notice.  She
didn't seem to understand him at all.  Oh,
well&mdash;women were light creatures of clothes
and moods and two-edged swords for tongues&mdash;or
deadly silence.  What could they know
about the deep springs of life&mdash;about how a
man felt when in trouble?
</p>

<p>
Jim shifted his position slightly, for the
hinge was beginning to trouble his shoulder
blade, and fetched a sigh that was almost a
moan.  Such had been his life, merely that,
and the future looked as bad or worse.  The
shilling bar grew a bit misty before him and
he knew it wouldn't take much to make his
eyes run over.
</p>

<p>
"Anything wrong, Jim?" inquired the
sympathetic bartender.
</p>

<p>
"Just a little blue to-night, Jack, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes I get into those spells myself.
Hell, ain't they?"
</p>

<p>
Jim nodded.  "I suppose they come from
nervousness."
</p>

<p>
The bartender nodded back.  "Or liver,"
said he, setting out the red bottle.  "Have
a smile."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't want any more of that
damned stuff.  A man's a fool to let it get
away with him, and sometimes I figure I
better watch out&mdash;not but what I can't control
myself, y'understand."  There was the
slightest interrogation in his tone.
</p>

<p>
"Sure y'can, Jim; I know that.  Still,"
dubiously, "like you say, a fellow ought to
watch out.  It'll land the K.O. on the stoutest
lad in shoes, if he keeps a-fightin' it."
</p>

<p>
"It's for use and not abuse.  Ain't I
right?"
</p>

<p>
The bartender conspicuously helped himself
to a swallow of lithia.  "Yep, sure," he
said.  "D'you know, Jim, I'm kind of sorry
you didn't go home to supper to-night."
</p>

<p>
"So'm I, but I got to talking&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you go now?"
</p>

<p>
"Too blue, Jack, and home is fierce when
I get there with a breath."
</p>

<p>
"Remember the time the little woman come
here after you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's no use bringing that up now,"
said Jim sadly.  "She liked me then.  Give
me a ginger ale."
</p>

<p>
Jim took his glass and sat alone at a round
table by the wall, under the painting of
Pasiphae and The Shower of Gold.  This saloon,
like many others, in Chicago, ran to classical
subjects.
</p>

<p>
Jim relit his cigar and slowly turned the
pages of a Fliegende Blätter, looking at the
pictures and habitually picking out those
letters in the text which resembled English
letters.  It was a frayed copy which had
inhabited the saloon for many months, and
showed it.  Jim had thumbed it twenty times
before, but he was doing it again to appease
his subconsciousness, to give himself the
appearance of activity of some sort.
</p>

<p>
But he was looking through the German
pages to the years behind him.  Politics&mdash;maybe
that was the trouble.  Politicians, at
least little fellows like him, got more feathers
than chicken out of it.  If he hadn't quit that
job with the railroad&mdash;but no, they were
drivers, and there was no future in the
railroad business for a fellow like him, a
bookkeeper.  He might have stayed there all his
life and not thirty men in the entire offices
have been the wiser, or have ever heard of him.
</p>

<p>
In fact, he had bettered himself by going
with the publishing firm.  He seemed to have
prospects there.  It wasn't his fault they blew
up and he was out on the street again.
That was how he got into politics&mdash;sort of
drifted in after meeting the big fellow
canvassing the saloons one night, when he, Jim,
had nothing else to do.
</p>

<p>
The big fellow was so attractive, so sure of
himself, and Jim would have seemed a fool if
he had refused the offer to clerk in an
election precinct that fall.  There was a little
money in it, and a little importance.
</p>

<p>
The big fellow had asked him to please see
what he could do for the ticket that fall,
and of course he had.  It was agreeable to be
consulted by the famous Ed Miles about
plans and all that.  He had never been
consulted in the railroad office, or even by those
publishers.
</p>

<p>
After election, without solicitation, Miles
had Jim appointed a deputy sheriff for the
State of Illinois, County of Cook, ss.  Of
course, he took it.  There was nothing else in
sight just then.  The pay was fair, the hours
good, and besides, there was no time-clock
to punch and no superintendent always
hovering about.
</p>

<p>
After a time the big fellow told Jim
pleasantly, but firmly, that his job had to be
passed around to some of the other boys, and
Jim resigned.  But the big fellow let it be
known that Jim was still a trusted scout.
That was an asset.  The landlord knocked
something off the rent of his flat, the street
car company gave him a book of tickets, one
of the bill-board companies sent him a nice
check for Christmas; but he had done some
rather particular work for them.  He had
respectable charge accounts in several places
and wasn't pressed.
</p>

<p>
But, after all, one cannot get rich on that
sort of thing; so when the child died, his
wife went back downtown as a stenographer
in a life insurance office.  She had been a
stenographer before their marriage.

<h3>
II
<br />
ONE FLESH
</h3>

<p>
The short swinging doors opened briskly
and five tall men entered quietly.  Jim tipped
his chair forward upon its four legs.  The
scat game delayed itself.
</p>

<p>
The five lined up at the bar.  "Beer," said
the one with the boiled shirt.  The skillful
bartender drew five glasses of foam.
</p>

<p>
Jim sat still in his chair, hesitating to
glance even obliquely toward the proceedings.
What was one against five?
</p>

<p>
The tall man with the boiled shirt pointed
to his glass, but did not touch it.  Nor did
any of his companions touch theirs.  The
saloon knighthood has not abandoned symbolism.
</p>

<p>
"Does that go?"
</p>

<p>
"It goes, Coffey Neal."
</p>

<p>
"And we don't get a lithograph in the front
window?"
</p>

<p>
"You don't."
</p>

<p>
The five men withdrew a little for conference.
Then Coffey Neal paid his reckoning
with a quarter and a nickel.
</p>

<p>
The bartender rang up twenty-five cents on
the register.  Neal pointed to the five-cent
piece upon the bar.
</p>

<p>
"That's for yourself, Jack."
</p>

<p>
The sardonic bartender placed it between
his teeth.  "It's phony," said he.  "Take it
back and put it in your campaign fund."  He
smiled, keeping his right hand below the bar.
</p>

<p>
"After election," Coffey Neal remarked
through his nose, "your old man (he meant
Jack's father-in-law) can't sell this place for
the fixtures in it."
</p>

<p>
Jack concealed a yawn with his left hand.
</p>

<p>
"You're the twenty-second wop since the
first of the year was going to put us out
of business, and we're signing a lease for our
new place next Monday.  It's where your
brother used to be located."
</p>

<p>
One of the enemy, a stocky fellow with a
brakeman's black shirt, was constructing
sandwiches of sliced bologna and rye at the
lunch counter.
</p>

<p>
"I know you're not eating much lately, old
boy, since you begun stringing with Coffey,"
smiled Jack from the corner of his mouth,
"but those is for our customers."
</p>

<p>
Blackshirt turned quickly about, sweeping
the pink hemisphere of cheese upon the floor
and shivering it.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dreadful!" he protested, falsetto.
"My word, how sad!"
</p>

<p>
He trod some of the cheese into the
sawdust.  "Mr. Barman, ah, Mr. Barman, you
may charge the damages to me&mdash;at the Blackstone."
</p>

<p>
There was a roar of laughter from the
others.  It looked like rough-housing, and
damage to fixtures.  The scat players had
vanished, in their naïve Teutonic way,
through the side door.  Jack began to hope
he wouldn't have to draw, for a shooting
always black-eyes a saloon's good name and
quiet scat custom shies at it.
</p>

<p>
Neal delivered Jim a tremendous thump on
the shoulder.  "Why, if it isn't my dear old
college chump."  Another thump.  "Maybe
you can buy us a drink with the collar
off."  A third thump.
</p>

<p>
"Now, can the comedy stuff, Coffey," Jim
snarled, smilingly.  If only he could steer
Coffey away from the fight he seemed bent
on picking.  "I'll buy&mdash;sure.  Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Then you'll go across the street to do it,"
Jack inserted.  "This ain't a barrel house."
</p>

<p>
Neal seized Jim's ear and lifted him to his
feet.  "You'll buy here, and now."  Three of
the men gathered about Jim.  The other
two, standing well apart, were watching Jack.
There would be three pistols out, or none.
</p>

<p>
Jim was being slowly propelled to the bar,
when the straw doors swung briskly and the
big fellow entered.  His shoulders, hands,
legs and jaw were thick, and his eyes were
amazingly alert.
</p>

<p>
Unspeakable peace spread through Jim.
He knew that somehow or other the big
fellow was going to get him out of this.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, that was what the boss had come
for.  News of the foray on this citadel of
his had been grapevined to him up the block
and around a corner.
</p>

<p>
He sized up the situation very quickly.
There was Coffey Neal, the trouble-maker,
the Judas who had refused to take his orders
any longer.  He was the one to be done for.
The other four were merely Hessians, torsos,
not headpieces.  They slugged for a living,
on either side of industrial disputes, according
to the price&mdash;sometimes on both sides in
the same strike.
</p>

<p>
"Have a drink, boys," said the great Ed Miles.
</p>

<p>
It surprised every man in the room.  Jim's
heart sank down again.  Could it be that the
big fellow was going to take water?  Then it
was the end of his reign and the end of Jim's
days at court.  There was a pause, a
whispering.  Ed, standing sidewise to the bar,
held his open right hand, palm upwards,
behind his coat so that only Jack could see it.
</p>

<p>
"And what if we wouldn't!"  Coffey spoke
with slow bravado.
</p>

<p>
"This."  The big fellow flashed at him,
and dropped the bung-starter heavily behind
his ear.  Coffey crumpled upon the floor.  The
sluggers hesitated half a second, then piled
on Ed so quickly that Jack didn't dare use
his gun.  Instead, he ran around the bar and
twisted his arm under the chin of blackshirt,
pulling him away from the heap.  He thrust
him up in the air, using his own knee for a
lever, then dropped him heavily on his back
on the floor and kicked his head.  There was
no time for niceties.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Jim had taken futile hold of
another slugger's foot, who easily shook him
off.  He was cautiously planning for another
hold&mdash;very cautiously indeed, not being
anxious to become too completely immersed in
the proceedings, when all at once the place
became full of people.
</p>

<p>
Strong and willing arms eagerly and quickly
unraveled the tangle.
</p>

<p>
"This is a hell of a game for eight o'clock
in the evenin'."  It was the bass voice of
public peace.  "Oh!" concernedly, "is it you,
Mr. Miles?  Are you hurted?"
</p>

<p>
The big fellow felt his shaven skull where,
in the melee, a brass knuckle had struck him
a glancing blow.  He looked at his red
fingers.  "Just a scrape, Sarje, not cracked,"
he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"What's the charge?" asked the detective
sergeant, solicitously.
</p>

<p>
"Tell 'em the facts," enjoined the big
fellow.
</p>

<p>
"Well," began the efficient bartender,
"Mr. Miles and me was talking quietly together
here; he was standing just there with his
back to the door, and I heard an awful
yelling going up and down in the street.  I knew
it was Coffey Neal, hunting trouble, and
drunk.  They come in the cigar stand,
swearing and cursing, saying they were looking
for Ed Miles&mdash;to cut his heart out.  But Ed
says to me he didn't want any trouble in the
place, so's he'd walk out, and he started out
the side door, when Coffey and this
blackshirt fellow come running in and threw that
bowl of cheese at him&mdash;see it there&mdash;and
jumped him.  Then these other bad actors
began kicking him, too, and I went in to
separate 'em&mdash;and I guess that's all.  Lucky
you came in or there might have been
trouble."
</p>

<p>
"What charge will I put agin 'em?"
</p>

<p>
"Drunk and disorderly; assault; assault
and battery; assault with intent to kill;
unprovoked assault; mayhem; assault with a
deadly weapon&mdash;and I guess they ain't got
no visible means of support," suggested the
big fellow.  "Oh! yes, and conspiracy."
</p>

<p>
"Let it go at that," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
The sergeant wrote it down.  The sluggers
were silent.  The case had become one for
lawyers' fees.  Their own talking couldn't
do any good.
</p>

<p>
"Any witnesses?" asked the sergeant.
</p>

<p>
"Me," said Jim.  "It was the way Jack says."
</p>

<p>
"Put 'em in the wagon," commanded law and order.
</p>

<p>
Coffey Neal was picking up his threads
again at the place he had dropped them.
</p>

<p>
"And what if we won't drink with you,
Ed Miles!" he muttered, somewhat scattered.
</p>

<p>
"Likely the Bridewell, Coffey," laughed
the big fellow.
</p>

<p>
The vanquished were escorted out into the
night.
</p>

<p>
The victor and his vassals, perhaps a dozen
of them by this time, remained in possession
of the field.
</p>

<p>
"Good thing I had those coppers planted
before I started anything," commented the
big fellow.  "Those strong-arm guys like to
got me going at the end."
</p>

<p>
"They certainly handled themselves very
useful," Jack acknowledged.
</p>

<p>
"They gotta be with us after this, or get
out of town."  The big fellow turned
suddenly on Jim.  "And you, you yellow pup,"
he roared, seizing him by the collar, "what
were you doing while they was pounding me
up?  D'you think you were at a ball game,
hey?"  He shook him back and forth until
his jaws cracked.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I was trying&mdash;I got one of 'em by the
leg, and he&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, like you'd pick flowers in the
spring&mdash;sweet and pretty&mdash;that's the way you
grabbed his leg."  He lifted Jim from the
ground and flung him on the floor.  "Yellow
pup!" he repeated passionately, over and
over again.
</p>

<p>
Jim raised himself to his elbow, but did not
dare to go further.  The big fellow's eyes
were still blazing.
</p>

<p>
"Honest, Ed, I was trying to help."
</p>

<p>
Miles took a step toward him.  "You're a
G&mdash;d d&mdash;d liar!" he shouted.
</p>

<p>
Jim tried to meet his look.  It was a
wretched business to be called that name
before a dozen others&mdash;it had happened to him
before, but he always hated it.  Still the big
fellow seemed especially vicious and
dangerous just now; Jim knew how senseless it was
to cross him when he was having one of his
spells, and besides, they never lasted long,
anyway.  Jim dropped his eyes again,
acknowledging the justice of the discipline.
</p>

<p>
Miles threw a ten-dollar bill on the bar and
broke the tension with a jolly laugh.  "Well,
I guess we've put Coffey Neal out o' this
primary," said he.  "Plunge in, lads."  Jack
served each man, but nothing for Jim.  The
code provided for a final display of
magnanimity by the fountainhead.  "Come ahead,
Jim," he growled, kindly.
</p>

<p>
Serenity unfolded again her frightened
wings and the smoke of peace increased and
multiplied over a leader fitted to lead and
followers fitted to follow.
</p>

<p>
The ensuing celebration spread itself over
many hours and into many taverns.  There
was some agreeable close harmony, to which
Jim joined a pleasant baritone, and much
revilement of all double-crossers, from Judas
and Benedict Arnold down to Coffey Neal,
and a certain Irish party whose name now
escapes me, but who grievously misbehaved
himself during a Fenian incident.
</p>

<p>
Very frequently they reached the shank of
the evening&mdash;as often, indeed, as anybody
wanted to go home.  And in the big fellow's
mouth the shank was ever a cogent argument.
</p>

<p>
Eventually the ultimate question as to their
further destination was put, and here the big
fellow stood aside, permitting perfect
latitude of decision.  He was a politician and he
knew that he could not possibly afford to have
it said by the wives of the ward that he
influenced their husbands toward sin.  He could
afford to have almost everything else said
about him, but not that.
</p>

<p>
Jim wavered, then resisted temptation.  His
record in that particular respect had been
almost absolutely clean.
</p>

<p>
He walked home stiffly, fighting with the
skill of the practiced alcoholic for the upright
position and the shortest distance between
two points.
</p>

<p>
His early morbidity had vanished.  If he
had done one thing badly that evening, he
had done another thing well.  Whatever his
wife, Georgia, might urge against him in
regard to his conviviality, wasn't he, after all,
one of the most faithful husbands he knew?
For all her superior airs, she had much to
be grateful for in him.
</p>

<p>
He entered his flat with little scraping of
the keyhole, and cautiously undressed in the
front room.  It was late&mdash;much later than he
had hoped for.  He could just make out the
hands of the clock on the mantelpiece by the
light from the street lamp.
</p>

<p>
He opened the door to their bedroom so
slowly, so slowly and steadily, and then&mdash;as
usual, that cursed hinge betrayed him.  The
number of times he had determined to oil
it&mdash;yet he always forgot to.  To-morrow he
wouldn't forget&mdash;that was his flaming purpose.
</p>

<p>
Psychological flux and flow may be deduced
from door hinges as well as from the second
cup of coffee for breakfast or the plaintive
lady standing immediately before your
hard-won seat in the street car.  Jim would never
oil the hinge in the morning, because that
would somehow imply he expected to come in
very late again at night, and he never
expected to&mdash;in the morning.
</p>

<p>
But her breathing remained regular, absolutely
regular; he had this time escaped the
snare of the hinge.
</p>

<p>
The gas jet burned in a tiny flame.  She
had fallen into the habit of keeping a night-light
during the past three or four years.  At
first he had objected that it interfered with
his sleep, but she had been singularly
persistent about it.  She hadn't given him her
reasons; indeed, she had never analyzed
them.  It was nothing but a bit of preposterous
feminism, which she kept to herself,
that the light made a third in their room.
</p>

<p>
She lay with her back to him, far over on
her side of the bed.  He could see where her
hip rose, and vaguely through the covering
the outline of her limbs.  Her shoulders were
crumpled forward, and the upper one
responded to her breathing, and marked it.
Under her arm, crossed in front of her, he
knew was the swelling of her breast.
</p>

<p>
And then at the neck was the place where
the hair was parted and braided, the braids
wound forward about her eyes&mdash;a very
peculiar way to treat one's hair.
</p>

<p>
What a different thing a woman was!  He
had seen her lying so countless times, and yet
the strangeness had never worn off.  Indeed,
curiously enough, there seemed even more of
it now than when they had just married, and
she was entirely new.
</p>

<p>
He often thought a woman didn't seem
exactly a person&mdash;that is, not like him, and he
was certainly a person&mdash;but something else;
just as good, perhaps, but quite other.  Her
body, of course&mdash;well, agreeable as it might
be, still he was glad he wasn't made that
way, for it seemed so ineffective.
</p>

<p>
And one of them could stand a good man on
his head.  He simply couldn't get the hang
of that.  If a man was angry and sulked,
he didn't mind.  In fact, he preferred it to
being knocked about as the big fellow
sometimes did to him.  He had never cared what
man sulked, his brother or father or any of
them.
</p>

<p>
And yet this woman, she&mdash;&mdash;he looked at
her intently, earnestly, as if finally to solve
her&mdash;she was very beautiful.  And she was
his wife.
</p>

<p>
He crept into bed, very softly, for she
might wake up.  But then, it briefly occurred
to him, what if she did!  He was perfectly
sober&mdash;at least to all intents and purposes.
He could talk perfectly straight; he felt sure
of that.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps she would now wake of her own
accord.  That would be the best solution, and
then he could appear drowsy, as if he, too,
had just been aroused from sleep.
</p>

<p>
He sighed loudly and turned himself over
in the bed, but she gave no sign.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia," he whispered very low.
</p>

<p>
Pause.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia," a little louder, "are you awake?"
</p>

<p>
No answer.
</p>

<p>
He touched her, as if carelessly.  She
stirred.  Ah, she would&mdash;no, her breathing
was markedly the breathing of slumber.
Perhaps she was pretending.  Oh, well, what was
the use of his trying, if she was going to
act so?
</p>

<p>
He turned noisily back to his side of the
bed.  He was disappointed in her.  Was it
fair of her to pretend&mdash;if she was pretending?
After all, she was his wife.
</p>

<p>
A husband has his rights.  That was what
the church said.  Otherwise, what was the
use of getting married and supporting a
woman&mdash;well, most men supported their
wives, and he intended to do so again soon,
very soon.
</p>

<p>
Yes, he had the teachings on his side.  He
wanted nothing beyond the bond.  It was holy
wedlock, wasn't it?
</p>

<p>
He placed his hand upon her waist.  And
yet she would give no sign.  More resolutely
than before she counterfeited the
presentment of sleep.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia!" he spoke aloud.
</p>

<p>
"What is it!" she said, quickly, sitting up,
her black braids falling back on her slim
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"I just wanted to say good night," he
muttered, huskily.
</p>

<p>
"Good night," she answered, curtly.
"Please don't disturb me again.  I am very
tired."
</p>

<p>
She was turning from him, when he placed
his hand on her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia, I love you.  You know I do."
</p>

<p>
The foulness of his poisoned breath filled
her with loathing.
</p>

<p>
"No, Jim," she gasped, afraid.  "Oh, no!"
</p>

<p>
"Georgia, you dunno how I love you," he
pleaded, almost tearfully, taking her in his
arms.
</p>

<p>
Quickly she jumped from the bed.  "Where
are you going?" asked the annoyed husband.
</p>

<p>
"I can't sleep here, Jim; I can't."  She
took up her underskirt and her thin flannel
dressing sack and passed from the room.
She made her couch on the lounge in the
front room and after a time fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
Jim twitched with nightmare throughout
the night, and long after she had gone
downtown in the morning.
</p>

<h3>
III
<br />
AN ECONOMIC UNIT
</h3>

<p>
Georgia's desk was in a rectangular room
which was over one hundred feet long and
half as wide.  There was light on three sides.
Near the ceiling was a series of little
gratings, each with a small silkoline American
flag in front of it.  These flags were constantly
fluttering, indicating forced ventilation; so
that although the desks were near together
and the place contained its full complement
of busy people, there was plenty of oxygen
for them.
</p>

<p>
This arrangement was designed primarily
for economic rather than philanthropic
purposes.  The increased average output of
work due to the fresh air yielded a satisfactory
interest on the cost of the ventilating
apparatus; and, besides, it impressed
customers favorably and had a tendency to hold
employes.  The office dealt in life insurance.
</p>

<p>
The desks were mounted on castors so
that they could be wheeled out of the way
at night while the tiled floor was being washed
down with hose and long-handled mops and
brooms and sometimes sand, as sailors
holystone a deck.  Much of the hands-and-knees
scrubbing was in this way done away with.
</p>

<p>
Rubber disks hinged against the desks and
set to the floor held them in place during
working hours.  Narrow black right-angular
marks showed where each desk belonged and
to what point, exactly, it must be moved back
when the nightly cleaning was finished.
</p>

<p>
These details were all of profound interest
to Georgia, for her desk was the most important
thing in the world to her at this time in
her life.
</p>

<p>
She delighted in neatness, order, precision,
in the adjustment of the means to the end.
Every morning just before nine, she punched
the clock, which gave her a professional feeling;
and hung her hat and jacket in locker 31,
which seemed to her a better, a more
self-respecting place for them to be than her
small, untidy bedroom closet, all littered up
with so many things&mdash;hers and Jim's.
</p>

<p>
Her mother, who kept house for them, was
a good deal at loose ends, in Georgia's opinion.
And it didn't seem quite the decent thing
that a woman who had nothing else in the
world to do should fail to keep a six-room
flat in order.  Of course her mother was getting
a little old, but hardly too old to do that.
</p>

<p>
Georgia had lately had a trial promotion to
"take" the general agent's letters&mdash;the
previous functionary, a tall blonde girl, having
married very well.
</p>

<p>
It was the first stenographic position in
the office and carried the best salary, so there
was a good deal of human jealousy about
it&mdash;much the same sort as freshmen feel who
are out for the class eleven.
</p>

<p>
Georgia had tried her hardest for five
days.  She had stayed overtime to rewrite
whole pages for the sake of a single omitted
letter; she had bought half a dozen severely
plain shirt waists, and yielded up her puffs.
Everyone knew how the old man hated the
first sign of nonsense.
</p>

<p>
But in spite of all that the day before he
had called in Miss Gerson to take his dictation.
</p>

<p>
Well&mdash;it was pretty hard, but she had done
her best.  And she was a better workman than
Miss Gerson, she would stick to that.  Only
yesterday she had seen Miss G. twice
hunting in a pocket dictionary hidden in her
lap&mdash;and she never had to do that, practically.
</p>

<p>
Life was just one damn thing after another,
as Jim was always complaining&mdash;only he
could never possibly have apprehended the
full truth and implication of that saying&mdash;in
spite of its rather common way of putting it.
She knew that he never saw deeply, really
fundamentally into the dreadful mystery of
being here; he couldn't for he was coarse and
masculine and he drank.
</p>

<p>
Her fingers were working rapidly casting
up purple letter after purple letter before
her eyes, but the physiologists tell us that she
was using only the front part of her brain
for it.  The rest of it was free to contemplate
the Ultimate Purpose, or gross favoritism in
the office especially in relation to Miss
Gerson, or whether an ice cream soda was a silly
thing to have before lunch, as she knew it
was, but then one had to have some pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Rat-tat-tat-tat went the keys; ding, there
was her bell.  Ten letters more on this line
said the front part of her brain.  One thing
she was sure of, said the back, she devoutly
hoped her young brother Al wouldn't develop
into a mere white-collared clerk&mdash;though of
course she certainly wanted him to be always
a gentleman.  She slid her carriage for the
new line.
</p>

<p>
Rat-tat-tat-tat&mdash;and again, ding.  There,
the end of the page.  Single space and not an
error.  She would like to see Miss Gerson do
that at her speed.
</p>

<p>
The shuffle of the old man's office boy
sounded behind her.  Now, wait&mdash;what would
to-day's verdict be?  Would he pass or stop?
</p>

<p>
"Miss Connor," a-a-ah&mdash;"the old man
wants you to take some letters."  (Georgia
had let them suppose she was unmarried.)
</p>

<p>
The benison of perfect peace now enfolded
her.
</p>

<p>
Poor little Miss Gerson&mdash;well, after all, life
is a game, the loser pays, and the winner can
be perfectly philosophical about it.
</p>

<p>
Georgia went to the old man's private office
and closed the door behind her.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."  She stood at attention, pad and
pencil ready.
</p>

<p>
"Will you take these please, Miss Connor?
Mr. James Serviss&mdash;here's his address," the
old man tossed the letter he was answering
over to her.  "Dear Sir: Replying to yours
of the 16th inst, we regret that&mdash;&mdash;.  Well,
tell him it's impossible.  Write the letter
yourself.  You understand!"  He was observing
her as if to probe her resourcefulness.
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Belmont saved me a great deal of
trouble in that way.  She could tell what I
would want to say."  Miss Belmont was the
blonde girl who had married and left a vacancy.
</p>

<p>
"I can do the same, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, here are some more," continued the
old man.  "This&mdash;No."  He tossed another
letter to her.  She made a shorthand
notation in the corner of it.  "This&mdash;By all
means,&mdash;and be polite about it.  This&mdash;An
appointment to-morrow afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"This&mdash;Routine.  And these&mdash;Send them
to the proper departments."  More notations.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You can start on those.  Bring them in
when they're ready."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."  Exit Georgia.
</p>

<p>
She summoned the deeper layers of her
vitality, settled to her work and her fingers
flew.  She knew the joy&mdash;if joy it be&mdash;of creation.
</p>

<p>
Quietly she slipped back into the old man's
office, without knocking.  His secretary had
entrance except at such times as he shut his
telephone off.
</p>

<p>
She seemed very slim and neat, and calm
and steady&mdash;almost prim, perhaps, as she
stood with pen and blotter in her hand to
take the old man's signatures.
</p>

<p>
But her being surged within her like that
of a mother who waits to hear if her boy is
to be expelled from school or forgiven.
</p>

<p>
The old man had been going over a campaign
plan for business with one of his quickest
witted solicitors, and after Georgia had
waited standing for a few moments, dismissed
him with, "Yes, that's the right line,
Stevens.  Just keep plugging along it."
</p>

<p>
As Stevens passed her on his way out he
bowed slightly.  He had been doing that for
some time now, though he had not yet spoken
to her.
</p>

<p>
Stevens was still under thirty, she
concluded, though she had heard he had been
with the company for ten years.  A silent,
sharp-featured, tall young fellow with chilly
blue eyes, who had the name in the office of
keeping himself to himself and being all
business.
</p>

<p>
The old man, having glanced over and
signed the letters, passed his verdict on her
work&mdash;"Hmm, hmm, Miss Connor, you may
move your things to Miss Belmont's desk.
And here's a note&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
When an author conquers a stage manager;
or Atchison rises 4% the very next
day; or the Cubs bat it out in the tenth on a
darkening September afternoon; when on the
third and last trial, it's a boy; or when
Handsome Harry Matinee returns you his curled
likeness <i>signed</i>; or you first sip Mai Wein,
you know what it is to move your things to
Miss Belmont's desk.
</p>

<p>
"And here's a note," continued the old
man, without the gap which we have made to
put in analogues, "to Mr. Edward Miles&mdash;I'd
better dictate this one myself&mdash;'Dear
Mr. Miles: I should be happy to have you
call&mdash;'  No, strike that out.  'In response to
your letter of even date, I should be glad to
see you at any time that suits you, here in my
office&mdash;' no, make it three o'clock to-morrow
afternoon&mdash;'to confer over the subject of the
Senatorial campaign in your district.'  Read
what you've got."
</p>

<p>
Georgia did so.
</p>

<p>
The old man changed his eyeglasses.
"Maybe you'd better telephone him instead,"
he said.  "It's Ed Miles, the politician.  You
can probably locate him at&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, I know," suggested Georgia.
</p>

<p>
"And get Mr. Somers on the phone&mdash;Mr. Somers
does some of our legal work&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And ask him to be here at the same time.
Make a note of it on my list of appointments."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him Miles is coming, and to get up a
little résumé for me of the situation in those
districts over there, and ah&mdash;perhaps an
estimate in a general way of what we ought
to do for, ah&mdash;Mr. Miles.  You will indicate
that to him."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, telephone him that."  Georgia rose
and went to the door.  "Ah&mdash;Miss
Connor&mdash;&mdash;"  She turned and looked at her
employer, her head tilted forward, with a
peculiar open-eyed, steady little stare, which
was a trick of hers when wholly interested.
</p>

<p>
"Did I indicate to you," said he, "that you
are my <i>private</i> secretary now?"
</p>

<p>
"I understand, sir.  Thank you."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
IV
<br />
THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE
</h3>

<p>
Each morning as Georgia entered the
elevated train and spread open her paper, she
cast off the centuries, being transformed
from a housewife to a "modern economic unit."
</p>

<p>
She smiled at the morning cartoon or
perhaps, in the celebrated phrase of Dr. Hackett,
she sighed softly for the sake of its
meticulous futility.  Her penny to the news
stand gave her full and free franchise upon
the ever anxious question of the popularity
of popular art.  Other Georgias of Chicago
were simultaneously passing like judgments
in like elevated cars and the sum of their
verdicts would ultimately readjust social
distinctions in Cook and Lake counties, Illinois.
</p>

<p>
She always turned to the Insurance Notes
next.  It was her Duty to be Well-informed
and Interested in the Success of Her Employer,
for His Success was Hers.  She hadn't
been to business college for eight weeks not
to know that.
</p>

<p>
Next a peek at Marion Jean Delorme's
column of heart throbs, which she frankly
regarded as dissipation, because she enjoyed
it, and everybody who read it called it
common.
</p>

<p>
By this time, home and its squabbling; its
everlasting question of how far a pay
envelope can stretch; her sullen contemplation of
Jim's alcoholism; and irritability at her
mother's pottering way had vanished into
the background of her mind, where they slept
through her working day.
</p>

<p>
She engaged herself with more appealing
problems and a larger world.  She deplored
the litter of torn-up streets and the thunder
of the loop, instead of the litter of the
breakfast dishes and the squeak of the hinge.  Not
that clean dishes are less meritorious than
clean streets, but, to such minds as hers had
grown to be, less captivating.  To change
desks downtown was more fun than to change
chairs at home.
</p>

<p>
She felt her solidarity with the other
people who streamed into the business district
at eight forty-five, to get money by writing
or talking.  It was the master's end of
the game and she belonged to it.  Outside-the-loop
worked with its arms and hands&mdash;she
worked merely with her fingers.  The time
might come when she would need to work
only with her tongue&mdash;and triple her income.
She was in line for that.
</p>

<p>
She was no mean citizen of no mean city
throughout the day: at the lunch club where
she coöperated; in the big white-tiled
vestibule of her building where she exchanged ten
words of weather prophecy with the elevator
starter between clicks; in the rest room where
they talked office politics, and shows, and
woman suffrage, as well as beaux and hats;
behind her machine which rattled "twenty
dollars a week by your own ten fingers and
no man's gratuity."
</p>

<p>
There were no oaths, no bonds unbreakable,
no church to tell her she couldn't change her
job, as it tells the housed and covered women
who get their bread by wifehood.
</p>

<p>
If she didn't like the temperature of the
room, or the size of her employer's ears, she
could walk across the street and do as
well&mdash;perhaps better.
</p>

<p>
If he had sworn at her, or come ugly drunk
into her presence&mdash;but that was inconceivable.
Employers didn't do that, only husbands,
because they knew they had you.
</p>

<p>
It was the full life and the free life which
she lived, she and her sisters of the
skyscrapers.  It was the emancipation of woman,
and the curse of Eve was lifted from them.
</p>

<p>
But the tide of her being which flowed
regularly each work-morning, ebbed regularly
each night.  Her horizon became smaller and
less bold after she had slid her nickel over
the glass to the spectacled cashier in the L
cage and was herded for home on the jammed
platform.  Her boldness continuously diminished
as station after station was called and
she stood to her strap, glancing from the
direct imperatives, "Uneeda Union Suit and
We Can Prove It," "Hasten to the House
of Hoopelheimer," "Smart Set Collars for
Swell Spenders," "Blemishes Blasted by
Blackfeeto," to the limp, sallow people who,
like herself, had left their vitality downtown.
</p>

<p>
When she pushed away from the light of
her home station into the gloom and up the
ineffectually lighted street between rows
upon rows of three and four story flats, her
head slightly bent, scurrying along with the
working woman's nightfall pace, like Lucifer,
she felt the mighty distance.  She had shrunk
into a middle-class wife who had been a poor
picker.
</p>

<p>
So it usually happened.  But the day of her
triumph over Miss Gerson was an exception,
and the corona of the office extended and
enveloped her through the rows of flat buildings
and up two flights of stairs to the door of her
own apartment.
</p>

<p>
She entered happily, gaily.  And there was
Jim sprawled in one chair, his dusty boots in
another, without a coat to hide his soiled
shirt sleeves, without a collar to apologize
for his unshaven chin, a frazzled cigar
between his fingers and a heap of ashes beside
him where he had let them fall upon the
carpet&mdash;her carpet that she had earned and paid
for.
</p>

<p>
Ashes had fallen, too, upon his protruding
abdomen.  He breathed very heavily, almost
wheezed.  He looked up to speak.  His eyes
were rather swinish in recovery from
debauch.  His teeth were bad and the gap which
had come under the cut lip was not a scar of
honor.  She hoped he wouldn't speak&mdash;but of
course he did.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Georgia."
</p>

<p>
"Hello," she answered mechanically.
</p>

<p>
"What you been doing?"
</p>

<p>
What a stupid question.  What did he
suppose she had been doing?  For when a
husband doesn't suit, he doesn't suit at all&mdash;his
very attempts at peacemaking become an
offense in him.
</p>

<p>
"Working," she said curtly and passed on
to their bedroom.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hell! cut out the everlasting grouch,"
he called after her, and went to the window
and looked out, kneeling moodily on the
window seat.  He was Henpecko the Monk, all
right.  What she needed was a firm hand.
Women took all the rope you gave them&mdash;they
took advantage of you.  He ought to
have begun long ago to shut down on her
nonsense.  Other husbands did, and by God,
he would begin.  Then he rubbed his prickly
chin and smiled ruefully.  For hadn't he
begun a great many times and had he ever been
able to finish?
</p>

<p>
Besides, he was broke, and it was strictly
necessary, most unfortunately in view of his
present disfavor, for him to obtain a loan.
</p>

<p>
Maybe Al would help him out and he
wouldn't have to ask Georgia.  There was an
idea.  It was more dignified, too.
</p>

<p>
He didn't know whether Al had come in yet.
</p>

<p>
He himself had occupied a twenty-five cent
seat that afternoon near Mr. Frank Schulte,
most graceful of Cubs, to get a little fresh
air.  It did a fellow good and took his mind
off home, which a fellow had to do now and
then if he was going to stand it at all.
</p>

<p>
On the return trip, to be sure, he had
suffered from a twinge of fans' conscience as
he realized that his activities of the day had
taken about fifty cents out instead of putting
any cents in.  A rather keen twinge, too,
inasmuch as Matty had been strictly "right."  There
is no fun in giving up half a dollar to
see the Cubs vivisected.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Al," he called to the back of the flat.
</p>

<p>
"What?" came the call back.
</p>

<p>
"Hear about the game?"
</p>

<p>
"Nope."
</p>

<p>
"I was out," said Jim.
</p>

<p>
That ought to fetch him&mdash;and it did.
</p>

<p>
Al entered expectant.  He was an extremely
good-looking boy of sixteen, with pink cheeks,
clear blue eyes, and a kink to his hair.  He
might have been called pretty if his shoulders
were not quite so broad.
</p>

<p>
"Who win?  I was north on an errand late
and couldn't get a peek at an extra after the
fifth."  So Al apologized to his brother-in-law
for his ignorance.  "It was one and one then."
</p>

<p>
"The Giants win, three to two, and believe
me there was a rank decision at the plate
against Johnny Evers.  He beefed on it
proper and got chased.  That's what smeared
us."
</p>

<p>
"Johnny ought to learn to control himself,"
said Al pathetically.
</p>

<p>
"Yep.  He's got too much pep&mdash;that's
what's the matter with that lad."
</p>

<p>
"And all the umpires in the league have
banded together against him.  I heard it
straight to-day.  And believe me"&mdash;there was
an element of mystery in the boy's voice,
"there's something in it."
</p>

<p>
Jim clenched his fist and brought it down
hard.  "If the Cubs win out against the
empires this year," he stated his proposition
with a vehement brandish of his fist, "they'll
be going some," but his peroration rather
flattened out&mdash;"believe me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, Jim.  That's no damn lie."
</p>

<p>
"Say, Al, loan me a quarter?"
</p>

<p>
Unhappy pause.
</p>

<p>
All sportsmen, from polo players and tarpon
fishers to Kaffirs in their kraals, like to
talk it over afterwards.  Al didn't want to
interrupt his baseball palaver with Jim.  It
might last right through supper and until
bedtime, as it often did when Jim stayed
home.
</p>

<p>
He had a vast fund of hypotheses to tell
Jim again, and some new ones.  If he refused
Jim the loan their interesting talk would
stop.  But if he granted it he would be a boob.
It was certainly one dilemma.
</p>

<p>
Jim smiled and repeated his thought.  "I'll
do as much for you some time.  Go on now."
</p>

<p>
Georgia came in quickly and angrily.  "I
should think you'd be ashamed, Jim Connor,
trying to do a boy."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, so you've been rubbering, eh?" Jim
sneered.
</p>

<p>
She had; but this, her weakness, was one
she shared with many other women&mdash;likewise
men.  In petty lives are petty deeds.  Downtown
she did not listen, or tattle, or read
other people's letters.  There were more
important matters to attend to.
</p>

<p>
"I got to have a little loan," said Jim&mdash;now
was his time for boldness&mdash;"to tide me
over till Monday."
</p>

<p>
She was obstinately mute.
</p>

<p>
"Let me have a two-dollar bill till then?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"One?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"What then?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing."
</p>

<p>
"You didn't use to be such a tightwad."
</p>

<p>
"You taught me that, too, Jim.  I'll never
give you another cent to drink.  It isn't fair
to the rest of us."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Talbot, Georgia's mother, the
homebody of the household, came in from the
kitchen to say that supper was now ready
and she was sick and tired of the irregularity
of the family meals, which she had never
been accustomed to as a girl.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, cheer up, mother.  I've good news to-day&mdash;a raise."
</p>

<p>
Georgia took her pay envelope from her
handbag.  "See!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Talbot flattened out the creases in it
and read it aloud.  "Georgia Connor&mdash;weekly&mdash;twenty
dollars."  And drew forth a wonderful,
round, golden double eagle.  Whereupon
Jim let his angry passions rise.
</p>

<p>
His wife&mdash;this cold-blooded, high-and-mighty
creature, with her chin in the air,
refused him a loan on the very same day she
was raised.  It was plain viciousness.  It was
almost a form of perversion.  Forbearance,
even his, had its limits.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Georgia," continued the mother,
reading the inscription from the envelope in
her hand, "how's this, they call you 'Miss,'
Miss Georgia Connor&mdash;weekly&mdash;twenty dollars."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;ho," exclaimed Jim roughly, for now
he felt that it was his turn.  "Passing yourself
off as unmarried, eh?  A little fly work&mdash;hey?
If I am easy, I draw the line somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"I was ashamed to let them know I was
married and still had to work out," she
responded evenly.
</p>

<p>
That was just the way it always happened.
Georgia invariably ended up with the best
of it.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, let it pass, though it's not
right.  But you ought to let me have a dollar
or two, considering.  Why, I've got a right to
some of your money.  You've had plenty of
mine in your time."
</p>

<p>
"For value received."
</p>

<p>
"You talk of marriage as if it was bargain
and sale."
</p>

<p>
Georgia's voice, which had been thin and
colorless, grew suddenly thick with the bitter
memories of seven years.  "It is oftentimes,"
she said.  "Bad bargain and cheap sale."
</p>

<p>
"And now and then it's a damned high
buy, too, when a man gives up his liberty for
a daily panning from his wife, and his
mother-in-law, and kid brother."
</p>

<p>
"If I am a kid," the boy interrupted
passionately, "I've brought in more and taken
out less than you the last year."
</p>

<p>
Blood called to blood, and the clan of
Talbot closed around the lone Connor.
</p>

<p>
"When he had to come out of school and
go to work because you couldn't keep a job!"
screamed the elder lady.
</p>

<p>
"You big stiff," Al brought up the
reënforcement half-crying with rage.
</p>

<p>
"You shut up or I'll&mdash;" Jim answered
hoarsely, drawing back his fist in menace.
</p>

<p>
Al jumped for a light chair and swung it
just off the ground, meeting the challenge.
So standing, the two glowered at each
other&mdash;Jim wishing that he was twenty years
younger, Al that he was three years older.
</p>

<p>
As Georgia stood back from them hoping
that she would not have to interpose
physically between the two, as had happened once
or twice in the past year, she felt more
intensely than she ever had before that her
home life was very sordid and degrading to
her.  This eternal jangling which seemed to
run on just the same whether she took part
in it or not, was the life for snarling hyenas,
not for a young woman with an ambition for
"getting on," for rising in the social scale.
</p>

<p>
The two males, finally impelled by a
common doubt of the outcome, tacitly agreed
upon verbal rather than physical violence.
The raucous quarrel broke out anew.
Mrs. Talbot&mdash;but you, gentle reader, undoubtedly
can surmise substantially what followed.
You must have friends who have family quarrels.
</p>

<p>
Finally there was a lull, after all three had
had their says several times over, and were
trying to think up new ones.
</p>

<p>
"Jim," said Georgia slowly and
deliberately, for she felt that the hour had come,
"why not make this our last quarrel?"
</p>

<p>
"That's up to you," he returned belligerently.
</p>

<p>
"By making it permanent."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean!" answered Jim, now
a trifle alarmed.
</p>

<p>
"I mean that the time has come for us to
separate, for the good of all of us."
</p>

<p>
She looked straight at him, until he dropped
his red and watery eyes before her strong
gray ones.  There was a pause, a solemn
pause in that poor family.
</p>

<p>
"Children," said the older woman softly
and timidly, "there is such a thing as
carrying bitter words too far."
</p>

<p>
"Mother, when two people come to the situation
we're in, Jim and I," for the first time
there was a semblance of sympathy for the
man in her voice, "then I believe the only
thing they can do, and stay decent, is to
separate.  To go on living together when they
neither like nor love each other&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?  I never said that,"
Jim said humbly.
</p>

<p>
"It is not what you say that counts.  We
don't love each other any more; that was over
long ago; that's the whole trouble; that's why
we quarrel; that's why you drink and I'm
hateful to you&mdash;and it'll get worse and worse
and more degrading if we keep on.  Oh, I feel
no better than a woman of the streets when I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Georgia," Mrs. Talbot raised her eyes
significantly, glancing at Al, to warn her
daughter against letting her son know a truth.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I have been thinking this over and
over&mdash;for months," continued the wife, "and
I kept putting it off.  But now I'm glad I said
it and it's done."
</p>

<p>
"The church admits of only one ground for
this," said Mrs. Talbot desperately, fighting
for respectability; "do you mean that Jim
has&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No," Jim denied indignantly, "you can't
accuse me of that anyway."
</p>

<p>
"And I don't care."
</p>

<p>
"You don't care?"  That was a most astounding
remark, clear outside his calculations.
Why&mdash;wives always cared tremendously.
Every man knew that.
</p>

<p>
"No, if need be I could forgive an act, but
not a state of mind."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Talbot found herself literally forced
to take sides with Jim.  This was an attack on
all tradition, on everything that she had been
taught.  "Why, I never heard of such talk in
my life."
</p>

<p>
But Georgia would not qualify.  "Well, I
think that's all."  She walked to the door.
"I suppose I have seemed very hard, but it
was best to make the cut sharp and clean."  There
was no sign of relenting in the set of
her mouth or in her narrowed eyes; and Jim
knew it was nearly impossible to do anything
with her when her nostrils grew wide like
that.
</p>

<p>
"All right," he mumbled, "have it your
own way."
</p>

<p>
"Try to brace up for your own sake, if
you wouldn't for mine."  That was her
good-bye.  She went from the room with Al.
</p>

<p>
The mother waited behind.  "She'll think
better of this by and by, Jim.  I'll speak to
her about it now and then," she said, "and
keep you in her mind.  And I'm going to the
priest about it, too.  It's sin she's doing.  And
Jim&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" he grieved humbly, almost crying.
</p>

<p>
"You better go over to Father Hervey and
tell him all about it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'll do that same."
</p>

<p>
"Well, good-bye for now&mdash;you better go
to some hotel to-night," she gave him a dollar
from the purse in her bosom, "and try and
get work.  It'll make your coming back
easier."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, mother, I'll do that same.  Er&mdash;I
guess I'll go in and change my collar.  That'll
be all right, won't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Georgia's in the dining room."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Talbot left him.  He rubbed his
knuckles slowly across his eye, his breath
catching quickly.  Then he spied Georgia's
hand bag.  There was the trouble-money&mdash;twenty
dollars, a round, golden double eagle.
He opened the handbag to&mdash;well, to look at it.
He spun it; he palmed it; he tossed it in the
air, calling heads.  It came tails.  He tried it
again and it came heads.  That settled it.  He
slipped the coin into his pocket, and went out
of the room.  At least there was salvage in
leaving one's wife.
</p>

<p>
After supper Georgia packed up his things,
every stick and stitch of them, and with the
aid of Al drew them out into the hallway.
</p>

<p>
Later in the evening a politician, one of
Ed Miles', knocked at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, ma'am, I'm from the Fortieth
Ward Club.  I have a message for Mr. Connor.
He's wanted at headquarters right
away."
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't live here any more."
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-066"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-066.jpg" alt="&quot;He doesn't live here any more.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;He doesn't live here any more.&quot;
</p>

<p>
The politician was perplexed.
</p>

<p>
"Where does he live?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," answered Georgia, shutting the door.
</p>

<p>
It was not until the next morning that she
discovered the loss of her money.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>

<br />
FOR IDLE HANDS TO DO
</h3>

<p>
The old man had gone to Europe for his
summer vacation, leaving Georgia secure in
her place with nothing to worry about.  She
had no more than half work to do.  Business
had slackened and the whole office was in the
doldrums.  Life's fitful fever had abated to
subnormal placidity.  Even her mother's
chronic indignation over trifles had been
quieted by the summer's drowse.
</p>

<p>
The only interesting moments in Georgia's
day were nine o'clock when she came and five
o'clock when she left&mdash;noon on Saturdays.
The Sundays were amazingly dull.
</p>

<p>
So was her home.  Al stayed away from it
from breakfast unto bedtime, with a brief
interval for supper.  He was engrossed in
prairie league baseball for one thing.  That
occupied him all day Sunday and half of
Saturday.  Of course he couldn't play after dark,
but whenever Georgia asked him where he
was going as he bolted from the table with
his cap, he answered, "Out to see some fellahs."
</p>

<p>
If she hoped that he would stay at home
to-night, for he was out last night and the one
before, he would explain, with as much
conviction as if he offered a clinching argument,
that "the fellahs" were a-calling and he
must go.
</p>

<p>
She was rather put out to find herself
unable to speak with the same vehemence and
authority to him as she had been able to use
with Jim concerning the folly and wickedness
of going out after supper.  For when it comes
to putting fingers on a man's destiny, a wife
is a more effective agency than a sister.  Even
in unhappy marriages husband and wife are
as two circles which intersect.  They have
common, identical ground between them.  It
may not be large, but such as it is it inevitably
gives them moments of oneness.  Brother and
sister are as two circles, whose rims just
touch.  They may be very near each other, but
at no time are they each other.
</p>

<p>
Georgia's restlessness and discontent
increased as the summer went on, probably
because she was affecting nobody else's destiny
to any calculable extent.  Her young brother
Al kept away, perhaps warned by a deep race
instinct that sisters are not meant to affect
destinies.  Her old mother was a settled case
already.  She wouldn't change; she couldn't
change; she could hardly be modified, except
by the weather or the rheumatism; she would
merely grow old and die.  No satisfaction
for a young adventurous woman in experimenting
on such a soul.
</p>

<p>
It has been said that neither the woman nor
the man alone is the complete human being,
but the man and the woman together.  This
woman, Georgia, who for seven years had
been completed by the addition of the
masculine element, was now made incomplete.  She
struggled in vain to find contentment in
regular hours, regular sleep, regular work and
regular pay.
</p>

<p>
She had supposed for years that peace and
quiet, and enough money, and never the smell
of whiskey were all she wanted.  And here
was her subconsciousness, which she couldn't
understand, making her perfectly wretched,
though she couldn't tell why; calling
insistently for another man, though she didn't in
the least realize it.  She only knew she was
tired of being cooped up in the house evenings;
she wanted to get out now and then for
a change and to see people who had some
ideas.
</p>

<p>
She went for a Saturday evening supper
to the Kaiser Wilhelm Zweite Beer and Music
Garden with a school-girl friend and her
husband.  This pleasure-ground was well north,
out of the smoke.  The night was soft and the
music lovely.  She was much entertained by
the husband's talk, and considered that she
held up her end with him very well.
</p>

<p>
The next time they invited her she spent
some little time before hand, "fixing-up" for
the occasion.  Ribbons were put back where
they used to be long ago when she first met
Jim.  Her hat underwent revolutionary
readjustment, as the school friend made plain by
heated compliments on Georgia's millinery
skill.
</p>

<p>
However, the husband seemed absolutely
content with its effect and Georgia's animation
increased throughout the evening, calling
back a long neglected flush to her cheeks and
a gay pace to her bearing.  She was not asked
a third time, however, which did not unflatter
her.  It was evidence that she had not slowed
down completely&mdash;that she was not finished.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Jim, after spreeing away his
twenty dollars, had gone West.

<h3>
VI
<br />
TRIANGULATION
</h3>

<p>
Mason Stevens, Sr., was a horse doctor in
Rogersville, Peoria County, Illinois.  He wore
a gray mustache and imperial beard in tribute
to that famous Chicago veterinarian who has
made more race horses stand on four legs
than any other man in the Mississippi Valley.
</p>

<p>
Besides horses, Mr. Stevens knew cattle,
hogs, sheep, tumbler and carrier pigeons,
bred-to-type poultry, and whiskey.  If he
hadn't carried a bottle about with him in his
buggy he might be alive now.
</p>

<p>
Mason Stevens, Jr., wanted to be a real
doctor, so he came up to Chicago to the Rush
Medical College.  After his first year, whiskey
took his father, the funeral took the rest, and
the young man after a brief fight gave up the
vision of some day substituting "M.D." in
place of "Jr." after his name.
</p>

<p>
He had been a respected boy at school,
green but positive.  To help him out, some of
his friends persuaded their fathers, uncles
or other sources of supply to give "Old
Mase" a chance to write their fire insurance.
He took the opening.  Presently his acquaintance
was wide enough for him to branch out
into life as well as fire.  After ten years in the
city he was able to go to the general agent of
his company and ask for a regular salary, in
addition to his commissions, on the ground
that there wasn't another solicitor in the
state he had to take his hat off to.
</p>

<p>
He was a highly concentrated product, like
most successful countrymen in the city.  He
hadn't been scattered in culture.  He knew
no foreign languages, no art save that on
calendars, no music he could not hum, no
drama save very occasionally a burlesque
show when he felt that he needs must see
women.
</p>

<p>
He knew, if he hadn't forgotten, how to
find a kingfisher's nest up a small tunnel
in the river bank, or a red-winged blackbird's
pendant above the swamp waters, or a
butcher-bird's in a thornbush with beheaded
field mice hanging from its spears.  Even
now, with farmer's instinct, he looked up
quickly through the skyscrapers at a sudden
shift in wind.
</p>

<p>
He lived in a rooming house and ate where
he happened to be.  His bureau was bare of
everything save the towel across the top, his
derby hat, when he was in bed, and a handful
of matches.  His upper drawer, usually
half-pulled out, was filled not with collars and ties,
but with papers relating to his business;
actuaries' figures; reports from all
companies, his own and his rivals'; records of
"prospects" that he had brought home for
evening study; rough drafts of solicitation
"literature" he was getting up for the
company.  He usually worked at night in his shirt
sleeves, his hat cocked on the back of his
head, his chair tilted back against the wall
under a single gas jet with a ground glass
globe that diverted most of the light upward
toward the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
Even after he reached the point where he
could afford more expensive living, he did not
change.  He wore better clothes because a
"front" was mere business intelligence, but
otherwise his habits were within a hundred
and fifty dollars of his first year.
</p>

<p>
Pleasure he regarded as the enemy, not so
much because of its money-cost, as because it
was diverting.  He didn't wish to be diverted;
he wished to sell life insurance and more and
more.  That was as far as he went with his
plans.  He didn't want to get rich so as to
gratify dreams, to have a beautiful wife and
buy her a big house and motors.  He simply
wanted to get rich.
</p>

<p>
He had had no romance since he left the
Rogersville High School.  That one had been
sweet enough for awhile, but nothing came
of it.  And he remembered that on account of
it he had neglected his studies senior year
and not graduated at the top of the class.
Indeed, the object of his affection, with fitting
irony, had herself achieved that distinction,
which cooled his fever for her.
</p>

<p>
Mason was a great believer in the value of
"bumps."  When he made a failure in any
enterprise, he was wont to analyze why, in
order to double-guard himself against a
repetition of it.  None but a fool repeats a
mistake.  He drummed that into himself.  Thus
in the long run he was ready to turn every
"bump" into an asset instead of a liability.
It is a system of philosophy widespread in
this nation, especially among country-bred
people of Puritan tradition, strong, rugged
people who believe in the supreme power of
the individual will, who minimize luck and
take no stock in fatalism.  These are usually
termed "the backbone of the American
people," and though of course they know that
God is everywhere and omnipotent, they
likewise believe that He has appointed them His
deputies, with a pretty free hand to act, in the
conduct of the earth.
</p>

<p>
Mason Stevens came of this stock.  And
though his father was a backslider, his
mother was not, and she brought him up on
the saying, "Maybe this will teach you a
lesson, my son, next time you think of doing
so-and-so."
</p>

<p>
This shows why Mason Stevens did not fall
in love with any woman, after the high school
girl, until he fell most desperately in love
with Georgia Connor.
</p>

<p>
He resisted love from conviction.  One
female ten years before had defeated his
brains and his purpose by her charm.  He
wanted no more of that.
</p>

<p>
But he had to fight.  Often enough as he
walked through the long office through the
double row of shirt-waisted figures bending
over typewriters and desks, it seemed imperative
for him to know them better, to wait for
one of them after office hours and ride home
with her on the car.
</p>

<p>
Everything else was wiped out of him for
the moment but just the question of riding
home with a twelve-dollar-a-week girl.  Then
he would walk quickly on past the girl who
absorbed his imagination, his mouth set and
his brows scowling.  And she would confide
in her neighbor that he was crazy about
himself.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes when he was at home under the
gas jet with his business papers on his knee,
the vision of fair women would float before
him, all the most beautiful in his imaginings
as he had seen them in pictures or on the
stage.  He might dream for an hour before
remembering that he was in the world to sell
life insurance and that women would hamper
his single-mindedness as surely as whiskey.
</p>

<p>
Who was the man he was surest of making
sign an application blank when he set out
after him?  The man who had a woman in
his head, every time; the man with the wife,
and children, which are the consequences
of a wife; or one who was gibbering in a
fool's heaven because a young girl had
graciously promised to allow him to support her
for the rest of her days.
</p>

<p>
So he kept away from bad women as much
as he could, and from good women always.
</p>

<p>
Especially from those in the office.  Their
constant propinquity was a constant menace
and he had known a lot of fellows to get
tangled up that way, and he wouldn't&mdash;if he
could help it.
</p>

<p>
But he couldn't help it after he knew
Georgia.  She was so useful mentally and
physically, and that was what he first noticed
about her.  He hated slackness of any sort,
especially in women, because he had trained
himself to dwell on women's faults rather
than on men's.
</p>

<p>
Her manners, he thought, were precisely
perfect.  She seemed to hit a happy medium
between gushing and shyness, and to hit it in
the dead center.  Her teeth were white and
good, and she smiled often, but not too often.
She never overdid anything, and her voice
was low and full.  She knew what you were
driving at before you half started telling her;
also she could make a fresh clerk feel foolish
in one minute by the clock.
</p>

<p>
She had the charm of perfect health.
About her dark irises the whites of her eyes
were very white, touched with the faintest
bluish tinge from the arterial blood beneath.
There was a natural lustre in her hair,
uncommon among indoor people.  Her steps took
her straight to where she wanted to go.  She
made no false motions.  When she looked for
something in her desk, she opened the drawer
where it was, not the one above or below.  Her
muscles, nerves and proportions were so balanced
that it was difficult for her to fall into
an ungraceful posture.
</p>

<p>
Considering these manifold excellent
qualities, the most remarkable thing about her,
he thought, was that she had not long before
been invited to embellish the mansion and
the motors of a millionaire.  He wrote
enthusiastically to his mother suggesting that it
would be nice to invite her to Rogersville for
a portion at least of her coming summer
vacation, which brought a most unhappy smile to
his mother's lips.  But since he did not
repeat his request, the invitation was not extended.
</p>

<p>
The first time that he knew he regarded
her as a woman rather than as a workwoman
was one afternoon when the declining sun
threw its light higher and higher into the big
office.  A ray shone on and from her patent
leather belt and into his eyes.  He looked up
annoyed from his work.  She was sitting a
few desks ahead by the window, her back
toward him.  Before very long the thing had
fascinated him and he found himself immensely
concerned with the climb of the sun
up her shirt waist.
</p>

<p>
It reached her collar in a manner entirely
marvelous and then precisely at the moment
when he was finally to know its effect upon
her hair, she lowered the shade.  What luck!
</p>

<p>
The next day was cloudy.  The next was
Saturday and she quit at twelve, before the
sun got around to her window.  Monday she
lowered the shade before the light got even
to her shoulder.  Little did she know of the
repressed anguish she was so bringing to the
gloomy young hustler behind her.  But on
Tuesday the sunlight reached her hair
momentarily as she leaned back in her chair and
gleamed and glittered there, a coruscation
of glory for fully thirty seconds&mdash;long enough
to overturn in catastrophe his thirty years
and their slowly built purposes.
</p>

<p>
He resolved hereafter to deal primarily not
in life insurance, but in life, which meant
Georgia.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
VII
<br />
A SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY
</h3>

<p>
During the ensuing days Mason was hopeless for work.
</p>

<p>
From the office books he found out where
she lived, slyly as he supposed, but not so
slyly that the information clerk didn't tell
someone, who told someone who teased Georgia
at the luncheon club, not thereby displeasing
her.  For he was a good-looking fellow
and capable; furthermore, he had always kept
himself to himself, so putting several noses
out of joint, it was said.
</p>

<p>
He had moments of anguished self-reproach
as he sat in his room in his boarding
house, his chair tilted against the wall
under the gas jet, his coat on his bed, his
derby hat tilted back on his head.
</p>

<p>
He knew that his life had been utterly
unworthy.  He had drunk it to the lees, pretty
near.  But now he was through with all that.
Hereafter, for her sake, he would conquer
himself and others.
</p>

<p>
His sense of beauty was limited by
inheritance and by disuse, but now he began to
draw upon all the poetry in his soul&mdash;not to
write to her, but to think of her.
</p>

<p>
His imagination, naturally fertile and
strengthened by the practice of his profession,
centered itself on the question of his
first kiss from her&mdash;where, when and how
should it happen?  He called all great lovers
from Romeo to Robert W. Chambers to his
aid&mdash;it must be under the moon, the
fragrance about them.  And a lake, a little lake,
for the moon to shine upon and magically
increase its magic.  He remembered the moon
on the river back in Rogersville, with the
other girl&mdash;the first one.  What mere children
they were.  That was puppy love, but this
was love; love such as no man ever felt
before for a woman.
</p>

<p>
He was hard hit.
</p>

<p>
The lake suggested a train of thought, so
he packed his bag on Saturday and went to
southern Wisconsin.  The resort dining room
was full of noisy youths and maidens who,
in his decided opinion had no proper
reverence for love, though they seemed perfectly
amorous whenever he suddenly came upon a
pair of them as much as one hundred yards
from the hotel.
</p>

<p>
He chartered a flatbottom after supper to
row out alone and contemplate the moon and
her, but the voices of the night and the frogs
were overwhelmed by the detestable mandolins
tinkling "My Wife's Gone to the Country, Hurray."
</p>

<p>
When finally he turned in he discovered
there was a drummers' poker party on the
other side of the pine partition, so it wasn't
until nearly daylight he dozed off, to wake a
couple of hours later when the dishes began
to rattle.
</p>

<p>
The boat concessionaire reported pickerel
in the lake and he joined the Sunday piscatorial
posse.  He returned with two croppies
and the record of many bites, mostly on himself.
</p>

<p>
He concluded he wasn't interested in fishing
anyway.  It was just a device to cheat himself
and make himself suppose he was having
a good time.  He couldn't have a good time
and wouldn't if he could, until he knew her,
until at least he knew her.  Why he had never
said ten words to her more than "Good morning"
and "Good evening."  He would call on
her; he had her address.  He would go to her
apartment and ring the bell and say, "Miss
Connor, I have come to call on you.  Do you
mind?"
</p>

<p>
No, that would hardly do.  It was too bold.
He mustn't seem at all crude to her, but
mannerly and suave and self-possessed.  A
girl, and especially one of her sort, would
object to crudeness.  He must be very courtly,
knightly.  Flowers on her desk every
morning, perhaps, not a card, not a word.  A
handful of sweet blossoms each day to greet
her and bear her silent testimony that there
was one who&mdash;&mdash;  She would know, of course,
in due time whence they came.  Not that he
would ever so much as hint at his gifts, but
her woman's intuition would tell her.  And
when she did realize in this way his silent
though passionate devotion, she would thank
him, gently and sadly, and a bond would be
made between them.
</p>

<p>
But then, what if the other people in the
office had intuition, too, or saw him bringing
in flowers!  No, decidedly that wouldn't do.
</p>

<p>
And then&mdash;just in time for him to catch
the 3:40&mdash;a blinding flash of warning
illumined his whole being.  What if, while he
was there shilly-shallying at a summer resort,
some other fellow was with her in Chicago at
that very moment!
</p>

<p>
"What if"&mdash;a ridiculous way to put it.
Wasn't it sure in the nature of things, that
at that very moment some other man was
with her?
</p>

<p>
He caught the 3:40.  He would call on her
that very evening and if indeed he didn't
declare himself bluntly in so many
words&mdash;hadn't he heard of numberless women who
had been won at first sight!&mdash;he would at
least intimate to her strongly, unmistakably,
that she was the object of his respectful
consideration and attention.
</p>

<p>
There were others in the field.  It was
time he declared himself in, too.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't until 5:37, when the train reached
Clybourn Junction, that he began to repent
his precipitancy.  He was going to see her
again in the office to-morrow, wasn't he?
Wouldn't it look queer if he went out to
call on her to-night without warning?  She
might be wholly unprepared for callers and
annoyed.
</p>

<p>
But his presumable rival bobbed up again
and spoiled his supper, so after dropping his
bag at home, he walked presently into the
entry way of 2667 Pearl Avenue.  Her name
was not on the left side; perhaps she had
moved.  No, here on the right, floor 3, in
letters of glory&mdash;"Connor." Above it, "Talbot."
</p>

<p>
Who was Talbot?  Married sister, roommate
or landlady from whom she sublet?  He
raised his thumb to the bell.  He had never
before experienced a moment of such acute
consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Wait a second&mdash;she might not be in.  He
walked out and looked up at the third floor
right.  There was certainly a light, a bright
one, and the window was open and the curtain
fluttering out.
</p>

<p>
Somebody was in.  It might be Talbot.  In
that case he wouldn't go up or leave his name
either.  It certainly was none of Talbot's
business, whoever Talbot was.
</p>

<p>
He pressed the button under her name.
"Yes?"  Heavens above, it was she, Georgia,
the woman herself.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, who is it!" came the voice once more.
</p>

<p>
"Stevens."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Stevens?" with a decided tone of
interrogation.  Evidently she did not place
him at all.  Probably not, with so many other
men about her.  It would be absurd to suppose
anything else.  She didn't place him&mdash;might
not even recognize him out of the office.
</p>

<p>
"Mason Stevens of the office."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Stevens of the office.  How do
you do?" and she spoke with a delightful
access of cordiality.  "Will you come up?"
</p>

<p>
"Just for a minute, if I may.  I won't keep
you long."
</p>

<p>
"Wait, I'll let you in."  The click-click-click
sounded and he was on his way upstairs.
She opened the door for him.
</p>

<p>
A quick glance.  There was no other man
in the room, anyway.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening," she said.  "Won't you
come in?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes," then very apologetically;
"that is, if I'm not putting you out."
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed."  He sat and paused.  She
smiled and did not help him.
</p>

<p>
"You're nicely located here, Miss Connor."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, we like it."
</p>

<p>
"Near the express station?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I usually get a seat in the morning,
but not coming back, of course."
</p>

<p>
"About three blocks, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Three long ones."
</p>

<p>
"A nice walk."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, this time of year, but not so nice in
winter when they don't clean the snow off the
sidewalks."
</p>

<p>
He felt that it was a bit jerky.  Perhaps
he should first have asked her permission to
call.  What a goat he was not to think of
that beforehand instead of now.  He paused
until the pause grew uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
She tried to help him out, "We're out of
the smoke belt, that's one thing."
</p>

<p>
He was seated in a rocking chair and began
to rock violently, then suddenly he stopped
and leaned toward her, his elbows on his
knees.
</p>

<p>
"I've been slow getting to the point," he
remarked abruptly, "but I came here on
business."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I wasn't just sure what."
</p>

<p>
Stevens took half a dozen life insurance
advertising folders from his pocket.  "You
know this literature we're using," he said,
running two or three through his fingers and
indicating them by their titles, "'Do You
Want Your Wife to Want When She's a
Widow?' 'Friendship for the Fatherless,'
'Death's Dice Are Loaded.'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes."  She took them from him and
read aloud.  "'Over the Hills to the Poorhouse,'
with a photograph of it, 'Will Your
Little Girl Have to Scrub?' with thumbnail
pictures of scrub ladies.  Ugh, what a gloomy
trade we're in, aren't we, Mr. Stevens?"
</p>

<p>
"This is the line of talk that gets the
business."  He spoke earnestly, tapping the
folders.  "You can't make papa dig up premiums
for forty or fifty years unless you first scare
him and scare him blue about his family."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I suppose so."
</p>

<p>
"And what I came for is&mdash;well, will you&mdash;would
you just as soon help me get up some
more of these?"
</p>

<p>
"You mean work with you on them?"  She
was truly surprised.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly."
</p>

<p>
She hesitated and then she said it was
impossible, but that she appreciated his kind
compliment, was flattered by it and thanked
him deeply, deeply.  For, of course, she
realized that Mr. Stevens was one of the very
best men in town at that sort of work and she
was afraid she couldn't possibly be of any
real use to him.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, not at all;" he was talking
business now and waved aside her objections
with his customary confidence.  Everybody
always objected to his plans for them when
he began talking, but in the end he was apt
to change their minds.  That was why he was
considered a premier solicitor.  "You've a
clear head and a good ear for words, that's
what's needed, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;" she tried to interrupt.
</p>

<p>
"And ideas, that's the point, ideas.  You're
clever."
</p>

<p>
"What makes you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so; I know."
</p>

<p>
"I'm flattered," she said firmly.  "But no&mdash;really."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I won't take that for a definite answer
yet." Of course not.  He never did.  "I
want you to think it over.  I have the utmost
confidence in the scheme and your ability to
carry it out.  You can tell me Monday in
the office what you decide."
</p>

<p>
"I can tell you now, Mr. Stevens."
</p>

<p>
He rose.  "Think it over anyway.  You
may change your mind."
</p>

<p>
She rose, too, not encouraging him to stay.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Connor," he spoke gravely, "there
was something else I came to ask you.  I'd
like to know you personally as well as in a
business way, if you'd just as soon.  May I
come to see you now and then?"
</p>

<p>
She did not answer.  She saw that it counted
with him.  He seemed really to care.  She
must not be brusque with him.  He must not
think her merely light-minded, unappreciative
of the compliment of his interest.  She
must tell him of her marriage.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, if you'd rather not for any
reason, why, that settles it," there was a
check in his voice, "and we'll say no more
about it." Still she did not answer.  He held
out his hand.  "Well, good-bye, then."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
He went to the door and opened it.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Stevens."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Miss Connor."
</p>

<p>
"I think you ought to know that isn't my
name."
</p>

<p>
"What is it, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Connor."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Connor?  Missis Connor?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
He came down into the room.  His glance
traveled rapidly to the four corners, like a
wild animal dodging men and dogs.  He had
one question left, one chance of escape.
</p>

<p>
"Are you a widow?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"No, a married woman."
</p>

<p>
Stevens went slowly out of the door
without replying.  The woman whom he loved
belonged to another man.  It was like the end
of the world.

<h3>
VIII
<br />
THE LIFE FORCE
</h3>

<p>
If Mason had been in the <i>jeunesse dorée</i> he
must now have gone to Monte Carlo to buck
the tiger or to India to shoot him.
</p>

<p>
As it was, he smoked all night and turned
up at the office half an hour ahead of time
in a voluble, erratic mood, brought about by
suppressing so much excitement within himself.
If he had known how to tell his troubles
to a friend over a glass of beer he might have
had an easier time of it in his life.  But he
wasn't that sort.  He took things hard and
kept them in.
</p>

<p>
He decided that the best thing to do with
his sentiment for Georgia was to strangle it.
Whenever he caught himself thinking of her,
which would certainly be often at first, he
must turn his mind away.  He must avoid
seeing her; if they met accidentally he would
give no further sign than a curt nod.
</p>

<p>
He remembered the farmers used to say
that there was one thing to do with Canada
thistles&mdash;keep them under, never let the sun
shine on them.  His love for this other man's
wife was like a thistle.  He must keep it
under, never let the sun shine on it.
</p>

<p>
He did it thoroughly.  He nodded to her in
the most indifferent way in the world when
they happened to meet, but he found no
occasion to stop at her desk to chat an instant.
Two weeks of his change of manner began to
pique her.  He was acting in a rather absurd
way, she thought.  After all they weren't
lovers who had quarreled, but simply
acquaintances, friends after a fashion, fellow
workers.  Why shouldn't they continue to be
friends?  It would be amusing to have some
one besides the family and the girls to talk to.
</p>

<p>
She would not let him treat her in this stiff
way any longer, just because she had had the
bad luck to marry a bad man years before.
What rubbish that was.  And what
self-consciousness on his part.  Men had a very
guilty way of looking at things.
</p>

<p>
They met quite or almost quite by accident
in front of the office building during the noon
hour of the following day.  He was about to
pass without stopping.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do, Mr. Stevens?"  Her voice
was quite distinct.
</p>

<p>
So he turned and lifted his hat.  "How do
you do!"
</p>

<p>
She did not precisely move toward him, but
she did so contrive the pause that it was up
to him, if he weren't to be boorish, to stop
for a moment and speak with her.
</p>

<p>
She threw a disarming candor into her first
question.  "Is there any particular reason,"
said she, "why we are no longer friends?"
</p>

<p>
"Friends?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  You've been frowning at me for
about three weeks and I haven't the least idea
how I've offended you."
</p>

<p>
He did not answer immediately and his
expression hardened.
</p>

<p>
"There, you're doing it now," said she with
apparent perplexity.  "Why?"
</p>

<p>
"You know," he spoke doggedly.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't."
</p>

<p>
"Yes you do, too," he answered curtly and
roughly.  "You do."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you please."  She turned from
him, apparently offended by his tone, slightly
nodded and walked slowly away.  She was of
medium height, no more than that, and
slender.  A brute of a man bumped her with his
shoulder as he passed her.
</p>

<p>
Stevens waited for the brute of a man, dug
his elbow into his ribs and overtook her at the
Madison Street corner.
</p>

<p>
"Miss&mdash;Mrs. Connor, I didn't mean to be rude."
</p>

<p>
"You were a little, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Will you excuse me?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course."
</p>

<p>
He didn't quite know what to do next, so
he awkwardly extended his hand.  She took it
with a man-to-man shake of wiping out the
score, which completely demolished his cynical
attitude in reference to platonic friendship.
</p>

<p>
"Where were you bound for?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nowhere, just strolling.  Over to the lake
front for a breath of air."
</p>

<p>
"May I walk along?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely."
</p>

<p>
On their way back they reflected that they
had been without lunch, so they stopped at a
drug store for a malted milk with egg,
chocolate flavor, nutmeg on top.
</p>

<p>
They touched their glasses together.
</p>

<p>
"It's very nourishing," said he with wonderment.
</p>

<p>
"Very," she replied, delightedly; "very."
</p>

<p>
They returned to their work in that state of
high elation induced by interviews such as
theirs, wherein the spoken words mean twenty
times what they say&mdash;and more.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
IX
<br />
THE PRETENDERS
</h3>

<p>
Georgia and Mason did not overpass the
outward signs and boundaries of platonism,
learning to avoid not merely evil, but the
appearance of evil.  When they met in the
hundred-eyed office they were casual.
</p>

<p>
During the autumn they took long walks
together every Sunday.  There had been a
dry spell that year, lasting with hardly a
break from the fore part of June, which
baked the land and sucked out the wells and
put the Northern woods in danger of their
lives.  The broad corn leaves withered yellow
and the husbandmen of the great valley
protested that the ears were but "lil' nubbins
with three inches of nuthin' at the tips,
taperin' down to a point, and where'll we get our
seed next spring?"
</p>

<p>
When the huge downpour came at last
and by its miracle saved the crop which had
been given up for lost a fortnight since,
Mason cursed the day, for it fell on the first
day of the week and cost him, item, one walk
and talk with Georgia Connor.  She stood so
near his eyes as to hide from his sight a
billion bushels parching in the valley&mdash;though
he was country bred.
</p>

<p>
To her their Sundays together brought not
a joy as definite as his, but rather a sense of
contentment, of relief from the precision of
the other days of her week.  It pleased her to
wander to the big aviary and look at the
condors and cockatoos and wonder about South
America where they came from, then to stroll
slowly over to the animals and have a vague
difference of opinion with him about whether
a lion could whip a tiger.
</p>

<p>
She thought so because the lion was the
king of beasts, but Mason didn't, because
he'd read of a fight where it had been tried.
Once he even grew a trifle heated because
she wouldn't listen to reason and fact and
stuck to the lion because he'd been called
the king of beasts, whereas all naturalists
knew the elephant and the gorilla and the
rhinoc&mdash;&mdash;  There she interrupted him with
a laugh and called him a boy and too literal.
</p>

<p>
Every Sunday they had this same dispute
until finally they both learned to laugh about
it and made it a joke between them, and
she told him he was doing much better.  They
walked by the inside lake and wondered if
the wild ducks and geese on the wooded isle
liked to have to stay there, and they took
lunch when they got good and ready, perhaps
not until two or three or even four o'clock
in the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
She always went home for supper, but
often she came out again afterwards, and
took the car down town to a Sunday Evening
Ethical Society which foregathered in an
old-fashioned theatre building.
</p>

<p>
There was almost always some well-known
speaker whose name was often in the
papers, perhaps a professor or a radical
Ohio Mayor or a labor lawyer, to address
them on up-to-date topics like Municipal
Ownership in Europe or the Russian Revolution
or the Androcentric World, which showed
women had as much right to vote as men, or
non-resistance, a kind of Christianity that
wasn't practical.  Stevens didn't like that
lecture much.
</p>

<p>
Jane Addams spoke once about the children
that lived in her neighborhood.  He
thought her talk the best of all; so did
Georgia.  He said to her that Jane Addams
was as much of a saint as any of those
old-timers that were burnt and pulled to pieces
and fed to lions, and a useful kind of a saint
as well, because she helped children instead
of just believing in something or other.
Georgia didn't answer his remark at the time,
but nearly half an hour later as she was
bidding him good night she had him repeat it
to her, and the next day she told him that
what he had said about Miss Addams was
very interesting.
</p>

<p>
They had organ music at these meetings
and a collection, so that he felt it was the
next thing to going to church.  But Georgia
in arguing out the matter with herself
concluded that there was so little religion in
the services that in attending them she
violated the Church's law against worshiping
with heretics hardly more than if she went to
a political meeting.  She would never go to a
regular Protestant service with Mason, even
if he asked her.  She made up her mind
firmly on that point.  So perhaps it was as
well he didn't ask her.
</p>

<p>
Her waking memories of Jim were now
much fainter and dimmer.  She tried not to
think of him at all.  She refused to let her
mother or Al speak his name or make allusion
to him.  At the beginning, just after his
departure, mama had harped on the subject
until she thought it would drive her
crazy.
</p>

<p>
Over and over and over again she traversed
the same ground&mdash;about his being her
husband, and Christian charity, and one more
trial, and the disgrace of it, and that it was
the first time such a thing ever happened in
the family.
</p>

<p>
Finally in self-defense and to save herself
from being upset every night when she was
tired and worn out anyway, she told her
mother that the next time she mentioned
Jim's name she would leave the room.  And
she only had actually to do this three times
before poor mama succumbed, as she always
did when she was met firmly.  However,
she still managed to say a volume in Jim's
favor with her deep sighs and her "Oh,
Georgia's," but Georgia always pretended
she didn't know the meaning of such signs
and manifestations.  Of course, especially at
the beginning, her husband's face often came
unbidden between her and her page, but she
gathered up her will each time to banish it
again, and it's surprising what a woman
can do if she only makes up her mind and
<i>sticks to it</i>.
</p>

<p>
But her dreams were the trouble.  Jim
would enter them.  She didn't know how to
keep him out.  And he always came, sometimes
two or three nights in succession, to
bring her pain.
</p>

<p>
She usually appointed her Sunday rendezvous
for an hour before noon at Shakespeare's
statue in the Park, and sailed off
cheerily in her best bib and tucker to meet
Mason, leaving behind her a fine trail of
excuses, a complete new set each week, to
explain to mama why she couldn't go to mass.
On this particular morning she said she had
a date with a girl-friend from the office.
</p>

<p>
With the best intention in the world she
was never on time and always kept him waiting.
She was so unalterably punctual for six
days a week that the seventh day it was
simply impossible.
</p>

<p>
Stevens usually became slightly irritated
during these few minutes&mdash;what business
man wouldn't?&mdash;and referred to his watch
at hundred-second intervals, determined to
ask her once and for all why she wasted so
much time in tardiness.  But when finally he
distinguished her slim little figure in the
Sunday throng that was streaming toward
him, his impatience left not a wrack behind.
</p>

<p>
They started gayly northward, bantering
each other in urban repartee.  As they passed
gray Columbus Hospital their mood swerved
suddenly and they talked of sickness and
death and immortality.
</p>

<p>
Her belief was orthodox, but it did not hold
her as vividly as it held the old folk in the
old days.  Had she lived nearer to the
miracles of the sun going down in darkness and
coming up in light; or thunderstorms and
young oats springing green out of black, with
wild mustard interspersed among them like
deeds of sin; of the frost coming out of the
ground; and the leaves dying and the trees
sleeping; she would perhaps have lived
nearer to the miracles of bread and wine, of
Christ sleeping that the world may wake.
</p>

<p>
But she lived in a place of obvious cause
and effect.  When the sun went down, the
footlights came up for you if you had a
ticket, and man's miracle banished God's
even though you might be in the flying
balcony and the tenor almost a block away.
Thunderstorms meant that it was reckless
to telephone; oats, wheat and corn, something
they controlled on the board of trade;
the melting of the snows showed the city
hall was weak on the sewer side&mdash;what else
could you expect of politicians?&mdash;the dying
leaves presaged the end of the Riverview
season and young Al's excitement over the
world's series.
</p>

<p>
Living in the country puts a God in one's
thoughts, for man did not make the country
and its changes, yet they are there.  Farmers
pray for rain or its cessation according to
their needs.  To live in the city is to diminish
God and the seeming daily want of Him, for
man built his own city of steel and steam and
stone, unhelped, did he not?
</p>

<p>
God may have made the pansies, but He
did not make "the loop."  His majesty is
hidden from its people by their self-sufficing
skill, and they turn their faces from Him.
West-siders do not pray for universal transfers.
</p>

<p>
Never had Georgia questioned her faith.
Its extent remained as great as ever.  She
had consciously yielded no part of her creed.
But its living quality was infected by the
daily realism of her life, as spring ice is
honeycombed throughout with tiny fissures
before its final sudden disappearance.
</p>

<p>
So she talked to Stevens of her convictions,
but in a calm dispassionate way, without
emotional fervor.
</p>

<p>
Stevens' great-grandparents whenever
they referred to the Romanist Church, which
was often, spoke of "the scarlet woman" or
"the whore of Babylon."  His grandparents,
products of a softer, weaker generation,
stopped at adjectives, "papist," "Jesuitical,"
"idolatrous."
</p>

<p>
His parents receded still further from the
traditions of the Pilgrims.  Indeed his father,
being a popular horse doctor, kept his mouth
shut altogether on the subject, and his mother
seldom went beyond remarking that there
was considerable superstition in the Catholic
service and too much form to suit her.
</p>

<p>
As for the son himself, he could as soon
have quarreled about the rights and wrongs
of the Mexican war as he would about
religion.  He wasn't especially interested in
either.  He thought there was a lot of
flim-flam for women in all religion, especially in
Catholicism.  But it was an amiable weakness
of the sex, like corsets.  So he let
Georgia run on, explaining her faith, without
interruption.
</p>

<p>
Then most wretched luck befell them.
Georgia looked up from the tips of her toes,
being vaguely engaged, as she talked, in
stepping on each large pebble in the gravel path
and her eyes rested squarely upon her
mother.  Mrs. Talbot mottled; Georgia
blushed.
</p>

<p>
All progress was temporarily arrested;
then the older woman puffed out her chest
and waddled away with all the dignity at her
summons.  But she could not resist the
Parthian shot&mdash;what Celt can!&mdash;and she turned
to throw back over her shoulder, "Who's
your girl-friend, Georgia?"  Her teeth clicked
and she continued her departure.
</p>

<p>
Stevens realized that there had been a
contretemps of some sort and that it was his
place, as a man of the world, to laugh it off.
</p>

<p>
"Who's the old pouter pigeon?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Mama."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"
</p>

<p>
Feeling that candor was now thrust upon
her, Georgia proceeded to explain to Stevens
that she had never explained about him to her
mother, for mama couldn't possibly understand,
being old-fashioned and prejudiced in
some regards.
</p>

<p>
"So you've made me fib for you," she
finished.  "Aren't you ashamed!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said he, in truth much gratified by
her clandestineness.
</p>

<p>
"But what I don't see is&mdash;&mdash;," he began,
then broke off.
</p>

<p>
"Is what?"
</p>

<p>
"Is why you should be so disturbed about
your <i>mother's</i> knowing."
</p>

<p>
"I've told you&mdash;for the sake of peace and
a quiet life."
</p>

<p>
"But what about your husband?"  He
blurted it out suddenly, the word which had
crucified him since his one and only visit to
her home; the word which he had kept dumb
between them until now.  "What about him?
Doesn't he mind?"
</p>

<p>
"He left me six months ago.  You never
supposed I would take a man's bread and&mdash;fool
him, did you, Mason?"  She called him
by his name for the first time.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know," he muttered, "I've been
to hell and back thinking of it."
</p>

<p>
"How did you suppose it would come
out?" she asked, fascinated objectively by
the drama of her life.
</p>

<p>
"I felt we were playing bean-bag with
dynamite&mdash;and we ought to quit&mdash;made up
my mind&mdash;while I was waiting for you this
morning to tell you this must be the last
time, because we were drifting straight
into&mdash;&mdash;"  He paused.
</p>

<p>
"Into what?"  There was a touch of gentlest
irony in her tone.
</p>

<p>
"Into trouble, lots of it."  There was a
touch of apology in his.
</p>

<p>
"And you didn't want trouble, lots of it?"  Her
irony was not less.  "At least not on
my account?"
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking of what would be best
for all of us.  I was trying to do the square
thing&mdash;the greatest happiness for the
greatest number."  There was a pause,
unsympathetic.  "Wasn't that right?" he ended with
no great confidence.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course, perfectly right," she
assented heartily.  "It shows consideration.
You considered the case systematically from
all sides.  Yours, and mine, and my
husband's, and the rest of the family's, and the
rest of yours, too, I suppose, didn't you?"  She
looked extremely efficient and spoke in
her business voice with a little snap to her
words.
</p>

<p>
She was quite unfair in taking this tack
with unhappy Stevens, who, however often
he thought of his duty in these twisted
premises, would surely not have done it if she
beckoned him away.  For she owned the only
two hands in the world which he wanted to
hold.
</p>

<p>
A woman, however, prefers to be the
custodian of her own morals and it gratifies
her at most no more than slightly to find
that her lover has been plotting with himself
to preserve her virtue.  It is for the man to
ask and for her to deny, sadly but sweetly&mdash;and
she doesn't care to be anticipated.  Especially
when she is self-perceptibly interested.
</p>

<p>
"But since you are already separated
from&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that makes it pleasanter all around,
doesn't it?" she led him on most treacherously.
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course&mdash;that's what I was
saying," he blundered.  "Now I can ask you
to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mason, I've a frightful headache, the sun
perhaps&mdash;and I think I will go home and lie
down, if you don't mind."
</p>

<p>
He looked up in some amazement at the
lord of day half hidden by the haze in his
November station, and it suddenly occurred
to him that woman is a various and mutable
proposition always.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with you, anyway?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," she responded with deliberate
unconvincingness, "nothing in the world, but
a headache."  She held out her hand.  "Don't
bother to come with me.  We might be seen.
Good-bye."  And she was off.
</p>

<p>
It was a winding gravel path and she was
lost behind a curving hedge before he started
in pursuit.  She quickened her pace when she
heard his step behind and it was almost a
walking race before he overtook her.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia," he exclaimed, somewhat
ruffled by her unreasonableness.  She neither
turned her head nor answered.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia!" he repeated more loudly.  Then
he took her wrist and forcibly arrested her.
</p>

<p>
"Please let me go," she requested with
supreme dignity, "you are hurting me."
</p>

<p>
"Not until you hear what I have to say.
Will you marry me?"
</p>

<p>
"Marry you?"  She dropped her eyes before
his frowning ones.  The shoulders which
had been thrown so squarely back seemed to
yield like her will and drooped forward into
softer lines.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he tightened his hold on her wrist,
"will you?"
</p>

<p>
"I am a Catholic."
</p>

<p>
"But isn't there some way around that?"  Your
man of business believes there is some
way around everything.
</p>

<p>
"No.  Divorce and remarriage aren't permitted to us."
</p>

<p>
"Don't they ever annul a marriage?"
</p>

<p>
"Not if it has been marriage."  A look of
misery came over his face.  She perceived it
and went steadily on.  "I had a child
once&mdash;that died."
</p>

<p>
He dropped her hand, unconsciously to
himself, but she felt it as a clear signal
between them.
</p>

<p>
"You see how little you have known me,"
she said softly.  "Poor old fellow, I'm sorry.
Too bad it had to end like this."  Her eyes
were now swimming in tears which she did
not try to conceal.  "Don't you see, dear, that
is why I kept putting off telling you things
about my affairs, and why I had tried to keep
it&mdash;friendship, because I knew when we came
as far as this we would have to stop."
</p>

<p>
"It will never stop," he said tensely,
"never."
</p>

<p>
Response seemed to sweep through her
suddenly, bewildering her by its unexpected
strength.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not," she assented slowly, "if&mdash;if
we&mdash;dare."
</p>

<p>
"Georgia," he pleaded, "you know that I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," in a whisper, "I know."
</p>

<p>
"And do you care, too?"
</p>

<p>
She looked up, and her answer was plain
for him to read.
</p>

<p>
"More than you will ever know, Mason,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia, are you a devout Catholic?
Does it mean all of life to you here and
hereafter?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not very devout.  Nothing like mother,
for instance.  I have grown very careless
about some things."
</p>

<p>
"Would you always be governed by the
teaching of the Church in this
matter&mdash;always&mdash;never decide for yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"When it came to such a big thing," she
said slowly, "I don't think I'd dare disobey."
</p>

<p>
"What are you afraid of&mdash;future punishment?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes, partly that," she smiled; "it
isn't a very jolly prospect, you know."
</p>

<p>
He was truly astonished.  He supposed
that everybody nowadays, even Catholics,
had tacitly agreed to give up hell.  Hell was
too ridiculously unreasonable to be believed
in any more.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia," he asked, "have you ever
looked much at the stars?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes; once in awhile.  Last Sunday
evening at Bismarck Garden Al and I found
the dipper&mdash;it was just as plain&mdash;is that
what you mean?  Of course I don't pretend
to be much of an astronomer."
</p>

<p>
"Some nights," he said, "when it's clear
I go up on the roof and lie on my back, and,
well, it's a great course in personal modesty.
Some of those stars, those little points of
light, are as much bigger than our whole
world as an elephant is bigger than a
mosquito, and live as much longer."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," she answered, "we know that
everything is bigger than people used to
think, but still couldn't God have made it all,
just the same?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you honestly believe," he rejoined,
speaking very earnestly, intent on shaking
her faith, if that were possible, "that
Whoever or Whatever was big enough to put the
stars in the sky is small enough to take
revenge forever on a tiny little molecule like
you&mdash;or me?  Do you honestly suppose that
after you are dead, perhaps a long time dead,
this mighty God will hunt for you through
all the heavens, and when he has found you,
you poor little atom of a dead dot, that he
will torment and pester you forever and
ever because you had once for a space no
longer than the wink of an eye acted according
to the nature he gave you?  If that is
your God, he has put nothing in his universe
as cruel as Himself."
</p>

<p>
She frowned in a puzzled way for a few
seconds, looking at him with an odd little
wide-eyed stare, then shook her head slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said he in answer.  "Some day
you will take your life in your own hands
and use it.  You're not the stuff they make
nuns out of.  There's too much vitality in
you.
</p>

<p>
"How old are you?" he asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-six."
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-six and ready to quit?  I don't
believe it."
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand, Mason," she
answered, "you can't.  You're not a Catholic.
Catholicism is different from all other creeds.
It is not just something you think and argue
about, but it has you&mdash;you belong to it; it is
as much a part of you as your blood and
bones."  There was a finality in her voice, a
resignation of self, which bespoke the vast
accumulated will of the Church operating
upon and through her.
</p>

<p>
Stevens knew suddenly that she was not
an individualized woman in the same sense
that he was an individualized man, with the
private possibility of doing what he pleased
so long as he did not interfere with the
private possibilities of others; he realized that
in certain important intimate matters such as
the one which had arisen between them she
was without power of decision, the decision
having been made for her many centuries
ago; and he felt the awe which comes to every
man when first he is confronted by the
Roman Catholic Church.
</p>

<p>
"You mean there is no way out of it&mdash;but
death?&mdash;your husband's death?"  His
self-confidence seemed to have departed as if he,
too, had met fate in the road.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered gently, "that is the
only way."  And then she smiled with some
little effort, but still she smiled, for she
detested gloom on her day off.  "Oh, Mason,"
said she, "why wasn't grandpa a Swede?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at her with amazement and not
without a trace of disapprobation, for her
eyes were dancing.  Was she actually making
jokes about his misery&mdash;to say nothing of
hers&mdash;if indeed she felt any?  He was
learning more about women every minute.
</p>

<p>
Now she was practically giggling.  He
frowned deeper and sighed.  Perhaps, perhaps
everything was for the best, after all.
He might as well tell her so, too.  No reason
to make himself wretched for something she
seemed to think hilariously humorous.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Georgia, I must say," he began
portentously&mdash;'twas the voice of the
husband&mdash;almost.  She could hear him complain.
Whereat she simply threw back her head and
laughed again.
</p>

<p>
He noticed, as he had often noticed, that
her strong little teeth were white and regular,
that her positive little nose was straight and
slender, and the laughter creases about her
eyes reminded him of the time she thought it
such fun to be caught in Ravinia Park in the
rain without an umbrella.
</p>

<p>
So presently he tempered his frown, then
put it away altogether, and his eyes twinkled
and he turned the corners of his mouth up
instead of down.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear me," he mocked, half in fun and
half not, "as the fellow says, 'we can't live
with 'em and we can't live without 'em.'"
</p>

<p>
But she, who had been reading him like a
book in plain print, asked, "Come, tell aunty
your idea of a jolly Sunday in the park with
your best girl.  To sit her on a bench and
make her listen while you mourn for the
universe?"
</p>

<p>
"But what are we going to do about it?"
he asked solemnly, "that's what I want to
know."
</p>

<p>
"Do?" she responded with a certain gay
definiteness, "do nothing."
</p>

<p>
"You mean not see each other any more at
all?" he asked desperately.  "I absolutely refuse."
</p>

<p>
"No, silly, of course I don't mean that.
We'll go on just as before, friends, comrades,
pals."
</p>

<p>
"When we love each other&mdash;when we've
told each other we love each other?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  What's that got to do with it?"
</p>

<p>
"It would be the merest pretense," he
declared solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"Then let's begin the pretense now, and
go up and throw a peanut at the elephant.
Come along."  She hooked her arm into his.
Her levity of behavior undoubtedly got past
him at times.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia"&mdash;he was once more on the
verge of remonstrance&mdash;"if you cared as you
say you do, if you <i>loved</i> me as I l&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She unhooked her arm and now she was
serious enough.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you understand," she said, "what
I mean?  We can't talk about that any more."
</p>

<p>
"You mean not at all?"
</p>

<p>
"Precisely."
</p>

<p>
"But what if I can't conceal the most
important thing in my whole life?  What if I
can't smirk and smile about it?  What if I
am not as good an actor as you?  What if I
can't pretend?  What then?"  He was very,
very fierce with her.
</p>

<p>
"Then I suppose I'll have to go home."  They
stood irresolute, facing each other,
neither wishing to carry it too far.
</p>

<p>
"Not that that would be much fun&mdash;&mdash;  Oh,
come, don't be silly&mdash;let's go attack the
elephant.  What must be, must be, you know."
</p>

<p>
She paused to allow him time to yield with
grieved dignity, then she headed for the
animal house; he trailed in silence about half
a step behind her during the first hundred
yards, but finally sighed and surrendered
and then fell into step and pretended during
the rest of the afternoon with quite decent
success.
</p>

<p>
So his education began.  And though he
was by no means pliable material, she
managed, being vastly the more expert, to keep
him pretending with hardly a lapse throughout
the winter.
</p>

<p>
She found it more difficult, however, to
keep herself pretending.

<h3>
X
<br />
MOXEY
</h3>

<p>
Moxey was a Jew boy and a catcher.  His
last name ended in sky, and he came from the
West-side ghetto.  His father and mother
came from the pale in Russia when Moxey's
elder brother Steve was in arms and before
Moxey himself appeared.
</p>

<p>
Moxey would have been captain of the
Prairie View Semi-Pro. B. B. Club, if merit
ruled the world.  But there was the crime of
nineteen centuries ago against him, so they
made McClaughrey captain; Georgia's
sixteen-year-old brother Al played third base.
</p>

<p>
The Prairie Views had one triumph in the
morning, it being Sunday, the day for two
and sometimes three games.  They had the
use of one of the diamonds on a public
playground from Donovan, the wise cop.
</p>

<p>
I have seen Donovan keep peace and order
among eighteen warring lads from sixteen
to twenty years old by a couple of looks, a
smile and a silence.  When there was money
on the game, too.
</p>

<p>
There has been good material wasted in
Donovan.  Properly environed and taught the
language, though he doesn't depend on
language very much, he could have been
presiding officer of the French Chamber of
Deputies&mdash;and presided.
</p>

<p>
It was the ninth inning, last half, tie score,
two out, three on, with two and three on the
batter.  In other words, the precise moment
when the fictionist is allowed to step in.  Moxey up.
</p>

<p>
He fouled off a couple, the coachers
screeched; the umpire, who was also stakeholder,
dripped a bit freer and hoped Donovan
would stick around for a few seconds
longer.
</p>

<p>
The pitcher took a short wind-up and the
ball, which seemed to start for the platter,
reached Moxey in the neighborhood of the
heart.  He collapsed.  They rallied round the
umpire.
</p>

<p>
"He done it on purpose&mdash;the sheeny&mdash;he
done it on purpose, I tell you&mdash;he run into
it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Naw, ye're a liar!"
</p>

<p>
"Prove it."
</p>

<p>
"It's a dead ball&mdash;take your base&mdash;come in
there, youse," waving to the man on third.
</p>

<p>
"We win.  Give us our money."
</p>

<p>
All participated but Moxey, who lay
moaning on the ground by the home plate.
</p>

<p>
Donovan strolled out to the debate and
smiled his magic smile.  "Take yer base,"
bawled the emboldened ump, and waved the
run in.  Al got five dollars for the day's playing
and three dollars for the day's betting,
and the Prairie Views walked off, bats
conspicuous on shoulders, yelling, "Yah!" at the
enemy.
</p>

<p>
"Chee," said Moxey to his playmates when
they reached the family entrance, "me for
the big irrigation."  And it was so.
</p>

<p>
Moxey shifted his foot, called his little
circle around him close and then inserted his
dark, fleshless talon into his baseball shirt.
"That gave me an awful wallop what win the
game," he said; "if I hadn't slipped me little
pad in after the eight', it might a' put me
away, understand."  He took out his protection
against dead balls, an ingenious and
inconspicuous felt arrangement to be worn
under the left arm by right-handed batters.
And all present felt again that there had been
injustice in the preference of McClaughrey.
</p>

<p>
Whenever they asked Moxey where he
lived, he answered, "West," and let it go at
that.  He always turned up for the next game,
no matter how often plans had been changed
since he had last seen any of them.  That was
all they knew about him.  He caught for
them, often won for them, drank beer with
them and then disappeared completely until
the next half-holiday.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Al was his most intimate friend,
and Al was the only one who learned his
secret.  "Say, Al," he blurted out almost
fiercely one evening, "your folks is Irish,
ain't they?"
</p>

<p>
"Irish-American," corrected Al.
</p>

<p>
"Well, mine's Yiddishers, and the most
Yiddish Yiddishers y'ever see."
</p>

<p>
Moxey seemed very bitter about it and Al
waited for more.
</p>

<p>
"My old man, well&mdash;&mdash;"  Moxey swallowed.
It seemed to Al as if he would not go
on, but finally it came out with a rush.  "He
pushes a cart&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;honest to God, he
pushes a cart&mdash;I thought maybe I ought to
tell you, Al."
</p>

<p>
"He does?"  It was a shock to the
Irish-American, which showed in his tone.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, he does," Moxey answered defiantly,
"and if you don't like it&mdash;why&mdash;well,
I won't say nuthin' ugly to you, Al&mdash;you're
only like the rest.  S'long."
</p>

<p>
Al threw his arm around the other's shoulder.
"Forget it, Moxey."  Which was the
only oath ever taken in this particular David
and Jonathan affair.
</p>

<p>
Not long afterwards, Moxey proposed to
Al attendance at a prizefight just across the
State line, the Illinois laws being unfavorable
to such exhibitions of manly skill or brutality,
whichever it is.  It was Al's first fight.
</p>

<p>
They boarded a special train, filled with
coarse men bent upon coarse pleasure.  But
then, if they had been bent upon refined
pleasure they wouldn't have been coarse or
it wouldn't have been pleasure.
</p>

<p>
The prizefighting question illustrates well
the gulf between the social and the individual
conscience and demonstrates that the whole
is sometimes considerably greater than the
sum of its parts.  Probably eight out of ten
men in this country enjoy seeing two hearty
young micks belt each other around a padded
ring with padded gloves.  But they hesitate
to come out in the open and proclaim their
enjoyment, for fear of writing themselves
down brutes, and the deepest yearning of the
American people at the present day is to be
gentlemanly and ladylike.
</p>

<p>
So whenever sparring matches are proposed
the community works itself up into a
state of fake indignation.  All the softer and
sweeter elements telegraph the Governor and
if that isn't enough, pray for him; and
inasmuch as the Governor gets no immoral
support on the other side from those who are
afraid of jeopardizing their gentlemanliness,
he yields, and appears in the newspapers as
a strong man who dared beard the sports,
whereas, he was really a frightened politician
who didn't dare beard the Christian Endeavorers.
</p>

<p>
One of the most illuminating essays of the
late and great William James concerned
Chautauqua Lake.  He spent a week at that
beautiful camp, where sobriety and industry,
intelligence and goodness, orderliness and
ideality, prosperity and cheerfulness pervade
the air.
</p>

<p>
There were popular lectures by popular
lecturers, a chorus of seven hundred voices,
kindergartens, secondary schools, every sort
of refined athletics, and perpetually running
soda fountains.
</p>

<p>
There was neither zymotic disease, poverty,
drunkenness, crime or police.
</p>

<p>
There was culture, kindness, cheapness,
equality, in short what mankind has been
striving for under the name of civilization, a
foretaste of what human society might be,
were it all in the light, with no suffering and
no dark corners.
</p>

<p>
And yet when he left the camp he quotes
himself as saying to himself: "Ouf!  What a
relief.  Now for something primordial to set
the balance straight again.  This order is too
tame, this culture too second-rate, this
goodness too uninteresting.  This human drama
without a villain or a pang; this community
so refined that ice cream soda is the utmost
offering it can make to the brute animal in
man; this city simmering in the tepid lakeside
sun; this atrocious harmlessness of all
things&mdash;I cannot abide with them."
</p>

<p>
But whether he could or not, the rest of us
have to, and the country moves Chautauqua-ward
with decorous haste.  From
anti-canteen and anti-racing to anti-fights and
anti-tights, the aunties seem to have it, the aunties
have it, and the bill is passed.
</p>

<p>
Al viewed this national tendency with
mixed feelings; with joy when he tasted
forbidden fruit and sneaked off across the state
line with Moxey in a special train full of
bartenders and policemen off duty and gay
brokers and butchers to see more than the law
allowed; with sorrow when he considered the
future of his country, as a gray, flat and
feminine plain.
</p>

<p>
The preliminaries had been fought off;
there was the customary nervous pause
before the wind-up.  Young men with official
caps forced their ways between the packed
crowds with "peanuts, ham sandwiches and
cold bottled beer."  The announcer, a tall
young man in shirt sleeves, who looked as
if he might be a fairly useful citizen himself
in case of a difference, made the customary
appeal.
</p>

<p>
"Gen-tul-men, on account of the smoke in
the at-mos-phere, I am requested to request
you to quit smoking."  (Pause.)  "The boxers
find it difficult to box in this at-mos-phere,
and you will wit-ness a better encounter if
you do."  (Applause, but no snuffing of
torches.)
</p>

<p>
"The final contest of this evening's proceedings,"
called the announcer, first to one
side of the ring, then to the other, "will be
between Johnny Fiteon and Kid O'Mara,
both of Chicago, <i>fer th' bantamweight
champ'nship o' th' world</i>."
</p>

<p>
Handclappings and whistlings.  But the
announcer, being gifted with the dramatic
instinct, knew how to work up his climaxes,
which, so far as he personally was concerned,
would culminate with the tap of the
gong for the first round.  It was his affair
to have the house seething with excitement
when that gong tapped.
</p>

<p>
"Gen-tul-men," continued the announcer;
then he spied two plumes waving in the
middle distance and made the amend, to
delighted sniggers: "Ladees and gen-tul-men,
I take pleasure in in-ter-ducing Runt Keough
of Phil-ur-del-fy-a."  A diminutive youth
with a wise face stepped in the ring and
bobbed his head to the cheers, and muttered
something to the announcer.  "Runt Keough
hereby challenges the winner of this bout, for
the championship of th' world in the
115-poung class, <i>to a finish</i>."  A tumult ensued.
The Runt backed out of the ring to hoots of
"fourflusher" and howls of approbation.
</p>

<p>
"Ladees and gen-tul-men, I now take
pleasure in in-ter-ducing to you Mr. Ed
Fiteon, father and handler of Johnny Fiteon, who
wears th' bantamweight crown <i>o' th' world</i>."
</p>

<p>
The crowd made evident its vehement
gratitude for Ed's share in Johnny's creation.
</p>

<p>
"Chee," whispered Moxey to Al, as they
sat close and rapt, with shining eyes, on the
dollar seats high up and far away, "they'd
tear up the chairs for Johnny's mother if
they'd perduce her."
</p>

<p>
But now something was happening by the
east entrance.  The cheering suddenly ceased,
A low anxious buzzing whisper ran over the
entire assemblage.  Men stood up to look
eastward regardless of monitions from
behind to sit down.  Something was cutting
through the crowd from the east entrance to
the ring.  It was Kid O'Mara in his cotton
bathrobe preceded by a gigantic mulatto and
followed by two smaller Caucasians.
</p>

<p>
Moxey's bony fingers dug suddenly into
Al's biceps.  "Kid, you gotta do it, Kid, you
gotta," he whispered.  "O, fer God's sake, Kid."
</p>

<p>
Al was surprised.  "Are you with
O'Mara?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Am I with him?" answered Moxey with
a sob in his voice; "am I with him&mdash;he's me
cousin."
</p>

<p>
"O'Mara <i>your</i> cousin?"
</p>

<p>
"Lipkowsky's his right name&mdash;same as
mine.  Look at his beak and see."
</p>

<p>
There was no doubt of it.  "Kid
O'Mara's" proboscis corroborated Moxey's
claim.
</p>

<p>
Johnny's entrance a few minutes later was
still more effective and his reception warmer.
Fight fans are courtiers, always with the
king.
</p>

<p>
When the two boys stripped, Johnny showed
short and stocky, the Kid lank and lithe.
Johnny depended on his punch, the Kid on
his reach.
</p>

<p>
They fought ten rounds and it was called
a draw, probably a just decision inasmuch as
the adherents of each contestant proclaimed
that the referee had been corrupted against
their man.
</p>

<p>
Besides, a draw meant another fight
between them with plenty of money in the
house.
</p>

<p>
This evening in fistiana was perhaps the
most powerful single experience which influenced
Al at this period of his life.  For a
long time he sat silent beside Moxey on the
return trip, pondering the physical beauty of
Johnny and the Kid and ruefully comparing
their bodies with his own.
</p>

<p>
He sighed, "And now I s'pose your cousin'll
go out and kill it to-night!"
</p>

<p>
"Not him," Moxey reassured; "he never
touches it in any form or shape, understand."
</p>

<p>
"He's training all the time?" continued
Al, bent on deciphering the secret ways of
greatness.
</p>

<p>
"Yep.  So you might say."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," then Al relapsed into silence to
wrestle with the angel of training all the
time.
</p>

<p>
Like most young fellows, Al regarded his
body as the source of all the happiness that
amounted to anything.  The brain was
merely its adjunct, its money maker and guide.
Its operations might lead to life, but they
were not life like the body's.
</p>

<p>
It flashed upon him in the train bound home
from the fight that he might achieve joy in
either of two ways, by going in for sports or
"sporting," by perfecting the animal in him
or by abusing it, by getting into as good
shape as Kid O'Mara or into as bad shape
as the pale waster crumpled in the seat across
the aisle.
</p>

<p>
So began a struggle in him, not yet ended,
between the Ormuzd and Ahriman of physical
condition.  His high achievement thus
far has been sixth place in a river Marathon
swimming race, his completest failure thirty-six
successive drunken hours in the restricted
district.

<h3>
XI
<br />
FUSION
</h3>

<p>
Al wasn't much of a head at books.
Georgia persuaded him to start in high
school, but he soon came out, for he found
that it interfered with the free expression of
his personality.  There were too many girls
about one and he became extremely apprehensive
lest he develop into a regular lah-de-dah.
</p>

<p>
Georgia was more afraid of his developing
into a regular rough and tough, so they had
a very intense time of it in the flat while the
question was under discussion.
</p>

<p>
Mother Talbot sided with neither of them.
She wanted Al to continue his instructions,
but in the institutions under the direction of
the Church.  She couldn't reconcile herself
to Al's getting his learning in a place where
the very name of God was banned, as it was
in the public schools.
</p>

<p>
Indeed in her opinion, and you couldn't
change it, no, not if you argued from now
until the clap of doom, the main trouble with
everything nowdays was impiety and weakening
of faith, brought about how?  Why, by
these public schools, these atheist factories
that were ashamed of the Saviour.
</p>

<p>
For her part, she couldn't see her son
going to one of them with any peace of mind,
and she wanted them both to remember, that
he would go against her consent and in spite
of her prayers.  What's more, if he was
undutiful in this matter he'd probably find
himself sitting between a Jew and a nigger,
which she must say would serve him right.
</p>

<p>
Did Georgia think, she inquired on another
occasion, that the priests weren't up to
teaching Al, or what?  To be sure, learning was a
fine thing for a boy starting out in the world
and she approved of it as much as any one,
but who ever heard of an ordinary priest
who hadn't more wisdom in his little finger
than a public school teacher had in her whole
silly head!
</p>

<p>
In a church school he would receive
instructions not only in temporal, but also in
divine learning.  He would be taught not
merely history and mathematics and such
like, but also goodness and pure living, which
were far more important for any young
fellow.
</p>

<p>
But Georgia could not be convinced.  She
said she had been to a convent and if she had
it to do over again she would go to public
high school&mdash;just as Al, who not only was a
considerate and loving brother, but also could
see clearly how sorry he would be in after
life if he didn't, was about to decide to do.
</p>

<p>
She finally had her way and Al picked up
his burden&mdash;and found it not so difficult to
carry after all.  For he joined the Alpha
Beta Gammas and rose rapidly in that order,
becoming its most expert and weariless
initiator, a very terror to novitiates.  But
precisely at the moment when the Alpha
Bets reached the zenith of their glory, the
skies fell upon them&mdash;the edict coming from
above that all fraternities must go.
</p>

<p>
Al went too.  The place was indubitably fit
for nothing but girls now.  And whatever
Georgia might say, this time he was going to
stick, for in the last analysis she was a female
and her words subject to discount.
</p>

<p>
He stuck, discounting the female; and she
was distressed like a mother robin in the
tree, whose youngling, that has just fluttered
down, persists in hopping out of the long
grass upon the shaven lawn, when, as all
robinhood knew, there were cats in the
kitchen around the corner of the house.
</p>

<p>
It is the impulse of youth to travel far in
search of marvels, a vestige, so it is said, of
the nomadic stage of human development,
when the race itself was young.  It was as
member of a demonstration crew for a
vacuum cleaning machine that Al enjoyed his
<i>wanderjahre</i>.  He went among strange people
and heard the babbling of many tongues
without passing out of Chicago.
</p>

<p>
Like a reporter, or a mendicant friar of
old, he knocked on all doors.  The slouch, the
slattern, the miser and the saint opened to
him; the pale young mother with a child at
her breast and another at her skirts and both
her eyes black and blue; or the gray old
sewing woman who for her plainness had known
neither the bliss nor the horror of a man.
One rolling-mill husky in South Chicago
chased him down stairs with a stick of wood,
and another heaved his big arm around him
and made him come in and wait while little
Jerry took the pail to the corner.
</p>

<p>
He came upon a household where one life
was coming as another was going, and a little
girl of twelve who could no longer contain
the excitement of the day beneath her small
bosom followed him into the entry way as
he hastily backed out, and whispered between
gasps to catch her breath her version of
family history in the making.
</p>

<p>
He learned early the value of the smooth
tongue, the timely bluff and the signed
contract; and grew rapidly from boy to man in
the forcing-bed of the city.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Moxey, not yet twenty, was
swimming in a sea of sentiment.  There was
a young Italian girl who worked in the
paper-box factory.
</p>

<p>
"Angelica," said he, "come to the dance
to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Nit," she responded.
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they'd give me the laugh, if I&mdash;&mdash;"  She
paused tactfully.
</p>

<p>
"Account of&mdash;&mdash;," he drew a semi-circle
about his nose and laughed unhappily.
</p>

<p>
"We-ell."  It was explicit enough.
</p>

<p>
"Can't see a guinea has anything on a
Yiddisher."  Tit for tat in love's badinage.
</p>

<p>
"I'm no guinea, I'm not," she exclaimed
passionately.  "I'm Amurrican."
</p>

<p>
"So'm I," he answered briskly.  "I'm
Amurrican&mdash;and I don't wear no hoops in
my ears."  Perhaps that would hold her for
a while.  It did.  She retreated in tears,
thinking of her sire's shame.
</p>

<p>
But her bosom was deep and her lips were
as red as an anarchist flag, and her little
nose tilted the other way.  So why stay mad
with her?  Her eyebrows nearly met in the
center, though she was only sixteen.
</p>

<p>
And as for dancing&mdash;well, he'd looked 'em
all over in vaudeville and he couldn't see
where they had anything on her.  More steps
perhaps, but no more looks&mdash;or class.
</p>

<p>
And Angelica went to dances with Irishers,
loafers who'd never take care of her, and she
wouldn't go with him.  Well, he'd see if she
wouldn't.  He'd own that little nose of hers
some day or know why.  He'd make money,
he'd be rich, he'd woo her with rings and pins
and tickets of admission.  He would be
irresistible in his lavishness.
</p>

<p>
Johnny Fiteon, bantamweight champion of
the world, contributed to the discomforture
of those members of his race who liked to
dance with Angelica, for on his second time
out with Moxey's cousin he lost the decision
by a shade.
</p>

<p>
Moxey knew he would beforehand.  Johnny
redeemed himself in their next encounter,
however, and put the cousin away, so there
could be no question about it.
</p>

<p>
And again Moxey, knowing beforehand
that he would, prospered and showered
Angelica with brooches.  Also he purchased an
equity in a two-story frame cottage with
Greeks in the basement and Hunkies above.
One shouldn't, he reflected, depend too much
on sports to keep up the supply of brooches.
</p>

<p>
"Aggie," said he, as they returned from a
dance together, "take a peep at this."  He
extracted a diamond solitaire pin from his
tie and stopping under an arc light gave it to
her to examine.
</p>

<p>
"I seen it," she snapped.  "You been
flashing it at me all evening.  Think I'm
blind?"
</p>

<p>
"Make up into a nice ring, wouldn't it?"
</p>

<p>
Angelica was wise.  She knew what men
were after.  She didn't work in a paper-box
factory for nothing.  She would let them go
just so far, to be sure, if they were good
fellows, but she could draw the line.  Indeed
she had already drawn it once or twice with
five thick little fingers on astonished cheeks.
She measured her distance from the ardent
Hebrew unconscious of his danger, but still
she paused for greater certainty.  Did the
diamond mean another proposition&mdash;or was
it maybe a proposal this time?
</p>

<p>
"I got my uncle in jail in Napoli," she
said very quietly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," he answered simply.  "But
what of it?  They had my brother Steve in
Pontiac once."
</p>

<p>
"My uncle he killed the man that spoilt
his daughter."
</p>

<p>
"That ain't nothing to be ashamed of,
Aggie," he spoke kindly, seeking to console
her, and took her small and stubby hand
gently in his long sinewy ones; "he done
right."
</p>

<p>
She never let him know, for her dignity,
how low she once had feared he held her,
and she kissed him goodnight many times.
</p>

<p>
"They say you people are good to their
women, Moxey," she whispered.  "Ours
ain't, always."  She paused.  "Gee, my pa'll
have a fit."
</p>

<p>
Moxey laughed.  "Mine too, I guess,"
said he, "but we won't have to ask them for
nothing, understand."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
XII
<br />
MOXEY'S SISTER
</h3>

<p>
"You'll stand up with me, won't you?"
Moxey asked, a bit anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Sure, of course," said Al.
</p>

<p>
"It's at night, and"&mdash;here was to be at
least one wedding where the groom was no
lay figure&mdash;"dress suits de rigger, understand."
</p>

<p>
"Sure, of course," Al assented impatiently.
Did Moxey think he didn't know anything?
</p>

<p>
"We ain't going to tell the old folks for
a couple of weeks to save hard feelings on
both sides, that's our motto.  And the kids
is to be Catholics, she stood pat on that."
</p>

<p>
"Sure, of course, what did you expect 'em
to be, kikes?"  Perhaps Al spoke a trifle
too explicitly, for Moxey flushed as he
frequently did.  It was his last remaining signal
to the world that his hide wasn't as tough as
he pretended.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't marr'in' her just because she's a
peach," Moxey rhapsodized, "but she is.
Wait till you see her and I'll leave it to you.
But she's got principle, too.  Her uncle killed
a fellow for wronging his daughter and Aggie
says he done right, if he is still doing time in
the old country.  Oh, there's plenty of
principle in dagoes, you can say what you like.
When you go foolin' around their women you
gotta take a chance."
</p>

<p>
It was as if Moxey had pressed a bell in
his friend's mind and opened a chamber
there, where vague shapes appeared and
suspicion had been gathering.  For Al had
observed Georgia's mysteries and evasions, her
care before her mirror, her new hats and
pretty ribbons, her day-long Sunday
absences.  Twice he had met her on the street,
walking and chatting most gayly with some
strange man.  Besides his mother had
plainly hinted that all might not be right.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think a fellow ought to do
if a man's after his sister?" Al asked slowly.
"This unwritten law thing don't seem to
work any more except down South."
</p>

<p>
"You can't lay down no rule," said Moxey.
"Depends on if you like your sister."
</p>

<p>
"If you do?"
</p>

<p>
"Then go the limit and take a chance with
your jury."  He paused and great shame
came to his cheeks again.  "I had a sister,
oncet ... and she, well y' understand....
I sometimes thought I oughta of
killed him ... but I never did
... I kept askin' myself 'what's the good of
killing him now?  Becky's done for anyhow, and
it'd just do for me, too.' ... The time
to look out for a girl is beforehand, not
afterwards."
</p>

<p>
There was no doubt about that, especially
in theory.  But Al contemplated somewhat
dubiously the task of safeguarding Georgia.
She was so blamed independent.  She might
say he was impertinent, or she might just
laugh at him.  She was fairly certain, at all
events, not to acquiesce readily in any watch
and ward policy which he might seek to
institute for her benefit.  Still&mdash;in a well
conducted family the men were supposed to
look out for the women and keep the breath
of dishonor from them.  He was the man of
the family now, if he was only eighteen, and
so it was up to him to find out if Georgia was
in danger, and if she was, to get her out of it
<i>beforehand</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I seen your sister once," remarked
Moxey, guessing his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Al was silent.
</p>

<p>
"Looked like she could take care of herself."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she's got good sense," said Al, "but
you know the riddle, 'Why's a woman like a
ship?  Because it takes a man to manage her.'"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," assented Moxey, "and they have
more respect, understand, for the fellow who
can say no to 'em when it's right."
</p>

<p>
So after supper that evening, instead of
going over to the pool parlor, Al stayed at home
waiting for his mother to go to bed, when he
could have a talk with Georgia and pump her
and find out about this strange man she knew,
and if necessary say <i>no</i>.
</p>

<p>
His mother drew up to the lamp and
darned his socks and talked and talked on
endlessly it seemed to him.  He felt a little
abused when nine o'clock came, which was
her bed time, and still she made no move to go.
</p>

<p>
She did get a little tiresome at times.  He
would acknowledge that frankly to himself,
though he would not let her see it for
worlds&mdash;except by staying away from her
most of the time, and not paying
attention to her when he was with her.
</p>

<p>
If his most affectionate greeting of the day
came as a rule when he said "Good night,
mother dear," he didn't realize it; and it
would have amazed him to know that sometimes
she sniffled for as much as half an
hour after she went to bed, because he had
shown so plainly that he was glad to be rid
of her.  She supposed in her sadness that he
was an unnatural, almost unparalleled
example of unfilial ingratitude; not suspecting
he was only a rear rank file in the Ever
Victorious Army of Youth.
</p>

<p>
Al wound his watch.  "Gee, quarter of
ten," he remarked, through a yawn.  He
stretched himself elaborately.  Mother was
certainly delaying the game.  Until she went
he couldn't have his round-up with Georgia,
who was in one of her after-supper reading
spells and had hardly said a word all evening.
</p>

<p>
She now had a fad for those little books
bound in imitation green leather that
constituted the World's Epitome of Culture series
and cost thirty-five cents apiece, or two
magazines and an extra Sunday paper, as she put
it.
</p>

<p>
She had been through twenty of them
already and was now on her twenty-first.  He
didn't deny that it was creditable to go in
for culture.  If that was the sort of thing she
liked, why, as the fellow says, he supposed
she liked that sort of thing.  It's a free
country.  But as for him, when he was tired with
the day's work, he thought he was entitled
to a little recreation&mdash;a game of pool, a
couple of glasses of beer, maybe a swim in a
"nat"&mdash;he wasn't bad at the middle
distances&mdash;and he couldn't see drawing up a
chair under a lamp and going to work again,
for that was what it amounted to, on a little
green Epitome that you had to study over to
get the meaning, or maybe look in the
dictionary, as she was doing now.  She had told him
that they were more interesting than the
other kind of books and had even got him to
start on a couple she said he was sure to like,
because they were so exciting&mdash;Marco Polo's
Travels and Froissart's Chronicles&mdash;but they
didn't excite him any, and he made only
about thirty pages in each of them.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, it was his private opinion that
Georgia was more or less bunking herself
with this upward and onward stuff.  She fell
for it because it helped her feel superior.
And then she worked herself up to believing
she really liked it because people were
surprised she knew so much and said she had a
naturally fine mind.  A vicious circle.
</p>

<p>
In all of which cogitations he was perhaps
not entirely astray; though her chief
incitement was more concrete than he supposed.
She wanted to impress Stevens in particular,
rather than people in general&mdash;she was
determined to keep even with him so that he
could never talk down to her as to a mere
"womanly woman" who held him by sex and
nothing more.
</p>

<p>
When at last Mrs. Talbot arose, Al hastened
to her, kissed her affectionately, slipped
his arm around her, impelled her towards the
door, opened it rapidly, kissed her again,
closed it firmly behind her, lit a cigarette,
and began: "Georgia, I want to have a
heart to heart with you."
</p>

<p>
"In a second."  She read the last half page
of her chapter so rapidly that she was
compelled to read it over again for conscience'
sake, then inserted her book-mark and turned
to him: "Fire away."
</p>

<p>
"Who's the mysterious stranger!"
</p>

<p>
She had known it was coming for the last
half hour.  From the corner of her eye, she
had spied the importance of the occasion
actually oozing out of young Al.  At first she
thought of side-stepping the interview, but
eventually decided not to, partly to please the
lad and more still to hear how her case would
stand when discussed aloud.  She had been
in a most chaotic state of mind ever since the
agreement with Stevens to pretend; that
which wasn't clear then was hazier now; she
was of ten minds a day whether to give in
to her lover or to give in to the Church.
Now she would listen to Georgia and Al talk
about the case as if they were two other
people, in the hope of finding guidance in her
eavesdropping.
</p>

<p>
"He is a man in the office whom I like,"
she answered.
</p>

<p>
"How much?"
</p>

<p>
"A lot."
</p>

<p>
"And he does, too?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a lot."
</p>

<p>
"Hmm&mdash;you know I hate to preach, but&mdash;"  Hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"You think you will, all the same.  Go on,
I'm listening."
</p>

<p>
"You know I'm liberal.  If you were just
fooling with this fellow, I'd never peep,
honest, I wouldn't."
</p>

<p>
She smiled, "I'll promise to only fool with
my next beau."
</p>

<p>
"Now, this is no laughing matter," he rebuked
her levity.  "If you're really&mdash;stuck
on each other&mdash;it may bust you all to pieces
before you're done with it&mdash;unless you quit
in time."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by 'quit'?"
</p>

<p>
"Give up seeing him altogether.  It would
be safer."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, so it would.  But what's that got
to do with it?"
</p>

<p>
"A woman can't afford to take chances,"
he retorted impressively.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me the people who get the
most fun out of life are the ones who do
take chances.  Your little tin hero, Roosevelt,
for instance&mdash;you like him because he'd
rather hunt a lion or a trust than a sure thing.
Jim Horan didn't eat smoke for the money
in it, but because he thought a wall might
fall on him some day&mdash;or might not.  That's
what he wanted to find out.  Well, perhaps I
want to find out if a wall will fall on me some
day&mdash;or not."
</p>

<p>
Al was astounded.  There was something
more than bold, something hardly decent in
the comparison of her own dubious flirtation
to a great fireman's martyrdom or a
soldier-statesman-sportsman's courage and career.
</p>

<p>
"But, Georgia," he expostulated, "you
speak like a man in a manhole.  Horan and
Roosevelt did their duty taking chances."
</p>

<p>
"Rubbish," she said.  "They acted
according to their natures and I will act
according to mine&mdash;some day."
</p>

<p>
He looked unutterably distressed, for he
loved her, and foresaw ruin enfolding her.
He knew that women aren't allowed to act
according to their natures, if their natures
are as natural as all that.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't seen Jim for over a year," she
went on, "nor heard of him for ten months.
He may be dead.  He is the same as dead to
me.  My heart is the heart of a widow&mdash;grateful
for her weeds.  The Church may say
otherwise&mdash;and I might obey unwillingly&mdash;but
my own being tells me that there is nothing
wrong in my love for Mason Stevens&mdash;any
more than it's sin to breathe air or drink
water.  That's how we're made.  When I
lived with Jim, I played no tricks.  But that's
over now, it's over for good.  What's the
difference whether he's under the sod or
above it, so far as I'm concerned?"  Her
eyes were alight and she walked back and
forth, gesticulating like a Beveridge,
persuading herself that what she wished was
just because she wished it.  "I've got a few
good years of youth left.  I'll not throw
them away for a religious quibble."
</p>

<p>
"You mean divorce and marry again&mdash;openly!"
</p>

<p>
"What does the ceremony matter?  I'm
not sure we'd take the trouble of going
through it," she shrugged her shoulders, "the
Church says that it means nothing anyway;
that it makes the sin no less."
</p>

<p>
"But, Georgia," he was beginning now to
fear for her common sense, "for God's sake,
if you do such a thing, first go through the
civil form anyway."
</p>

<p>
She laughed triumphantly.  She had
caught him.  "There spoke your heart.  Of
course, we'll have a legal marriage.  You
see the Church hasn't convinced you, either,
that divorce and remarriage is the same as
adultery."
</p>

<p>
She had crystallized her vague desires into
positive determination by the daring sound
of her own words.

<h3>
XIII
<br />
REËNTER JIM
</h3>

<p>
Al reflected moodily that arguing with a
woman never gets you anything.  If he had
been trying to interest Georgia in a vacuum
cleaner, he would have known better than
to start in by arousing her to a fervor for
brooms.  Now he would have to wait a few
days until she had cooled out, and then try
her on a different tack, appealing to her
affection and begging her not to bring disgrace
upon the whole family.
</p>

<p>
She was half-sitting, half-kneeling on the
window seat, her elbows on the sill, her
cheeks in her hands, looking out into the dim
urban night.  Directly to the south, over the
loop, where Chicago was wide awake and
playing, the diffused electric radiance was
brightest and highest&mdash;a man-made borealis.
</p>

<p>
She took pride in her big city.  It was
unafraid.  It followed no rules but its own, and
didn't always follow them.  It owned the
future in fee and pitied the past.  It said, not
"Ought I?" but "I will."  It was modern,
just as she was modern.  She was more
characteristically the offspring of her city than of
her mother.  For she was new, like Chicago;
and her mother was old, like the Church.
</p>

<p>
So she pondered in the pleasant after-glow
of decision, buttressing her resolve.
</p>

<p>
The bell rang from the vestibule below and
she went to the speaking tube to find out what
was wanted.  "Yes?" she inquired, then
without saying anything more she walked
slowly to her room.
</p>

<p>
"Who was it!" asked Al, but she closed the
door behind her without answering.  Funny
things, women.  He went to the tube himself.
</p>

<p>
"What you want?"
</p>

<p>
"It's Jim."
</p>

<p>
"Jim?&mdash;well, for the love of goodness
godness Agnes&mdash;d'you want to come up?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, if it's all right."
</p>

<p>
Al pressed the door-opener, but before
climbing the stairs Jim shouted another
question through the tube: "Wasn't that
Georgia who spoke first?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, why did she&mdash;how is she, anyway!"
</p>

<p>
"Fine.  Come along."
</p>

<p>
There was a great change in Jim.  He must
have taken off forty or fifty pounds.  His
eyes were clear, his skin healthily brown, and
he had hardened up all over.  He looked a
good ten years younger than the last time
Al saw him, except for one thing, that his
hair had thinned out a great deal.  He was
almost bald on top.
</p>

<p>
They shook hands and Jim gave him a solid
grip.  "Cheese," said the younger fellow
heartily, "you look good&mdash;primed for a
battle, almost."  He put his fingers on the
other's biceps.
</p>

<p>
Jim drew up his clenched fist, showing a
very respectable bunch of muscle.  "More
than there ever used to be, eh?" he asked,
smiling broadly.
</p>

<p>
Al whistled, stepped back for a better look
at the miracle, and whistled.  "And yet they
say they never come back.  Hm-m-m&mdash;how'd
you do it?"
</p>

<p>
"Working.  Rousty on a dredge in Oklahoma."
</p>

<p>
"Rousty?"
</p>

<p>
"Toted coal to the firemen, later got to
firing myself&mdash;on the night shift.  We kept
her going steady.  Funny thing, irrigating
way out there, t'hell an' gone, in the middle
of the frogs barking and the cattle bawling
feeding your old thirty-horse and watching
the old scoop lifting out her yard of sludge
every six minutes.  You got so it seemed
the most natural thing in the world, but it
ain't, is it!"
</p>

<p>
"What'd they pay!"
</p>

<p>
"Fifty and board.  But the money's being
in the business.  Me and our day trainman
was talking of getting shares in a dredge.
There's work there for a thousand years.
Where's Georgia?"
</p>

<p>
Al nodded his head toward her door.
</p>

<p>
"So's not to see me!"
</p>

<p>
Al nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I came clear from there in the busy season
for the sight of her and I didn't come alone.
I've three hundred here," said Jim, taking a
roll of bills from his pocket.  "And to be
turned down this way, with my heart full of
love&mdash;&mdash;"  He was greatly moved and he
showed it, for his lip trembled and his voice
shook.
</p>

<p>
Al was sorry for him.  "Aw, she'll come
around.  She's got a stubborn streak, you
know that, but she does right in the end.
Give her time.  I'll talk to her."
</p>

<p>
Jim felt sure that she must have heard
their conversation, especially the last part of
it, for he had talked quite distinctly and he
remembered from the old days how readily
all the sounds in the flat penetrated into that
room.  He got on his hands and knees and
looked at the crack beneath her door to see
if her room was lighted.
</p>

<p>
"She's sitting in the dark," he whispered,
"Would it be all right to knock!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Al uncertainly.
</p>

<p>
Jim knocked softly, then a little more loudly,
but there was no answer.  He put his ear
to the door to listen, then tip-toed away.
</p>

<p>
"She's crying," he whispered to Al, "crying
to beat the band.  Those heavy deep kind
of sobs.  I could barely hear her.  Must have
her face in the pillow.  Now what do you
know about that!"
</p>

<p>
"That's a good sign," said Al, "means
she's coming around.  When she just turns
white and don't speak&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Jim privately opined that he understood
Georgia's moods vastly better than Al ever
would, and was in no need of instruction on
this subject.
</p>

<p>
"You mean when she has one of her
silences," he said, giving the thing its proper
name.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's when you can't handle her.
But now, she's begun to melt already.  So
to-morrow evening come for supper, and I
bet my shirt you are all made up in thirty
minutes."
</p>

<p>
Jim wrung his hand.  "You're a thoroughbred,
Al&mdash;and take this from me now, I've
learned sense.  If I get her back, I'll keep
her.  No more booze, never one drop."
</p>

<p>
He counted out four five-dollar bills upon
the center table.  "That's what I borrowed,
when I quit," he explained.  As he reached
the door he turned to confirm his happy
appointment.  "Six thirty to-morrow evening?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
XIV
<br />
THE PALACE OF THE UNBORN
</h3>

<p>
The following morning brother and sister
rode down-town together in the cars.  "Don't
you think you might have consulted me
before asking Jim to supper?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be foolish," he replied cheerfully,
"you were locked in your room."
</p>

<p>
She worked all day in that state of
suppressed excitement which presages great
events, from the first ride on the lodge goat
to the codicil part of uncle's will.  Everything
she saw or touched was more vivid than
usual to her senses.  Her typewriter keys
seemed picked out in the air against a deep
perspective, their lettering very heavy, their
clicking singularly loud.  One of the little
flags caught in a ventilation grill, and
instead of fluttering out freely, flapped and
bellied, making a small snapping noise.  A
flag wasn't meant to do that, so she crossed
the big room, pulled up a chair and released
it, somewhat to the surprise of the youth
sitting directly beneath it.
</p>

<p>
The old man, usually rapid enough with
his letters, seemed hopelessly slow and
awkward this morning, and she had to bite her
tongue to keep from helping him out with the
proper word when he got stuck.  He was
leaning back in his swivel chair, wasting
interminable time with pauses and laryngeal
interjections, the tips of his fingers together,
his eyes half closed, droning out his sentences.
He wore a little butterfly tie, to-day,
blue spots on brown, just below his active
Adam's apple and thin, corded neck.  Under
the point of his chin was a little patch which
his razor had skipped, hopelessly white.  She
wondered what could be in it for him any
more, and why he didn't retire.
</p>

<p>
She rattled off her letters, then added a
note for Stevens, "Dinner to-night?" and left
it in the S compartment of the <i>Letters
Received</i> box.
</p>

<p>
When he came in later for his afternoon
mail he caught her eye and nodded, and on
the way out of the old man's office stopped
at her desk for a few hasty words: "What
time, and where?"
</p>

<p>
"Wherever you like&mdash;at six thirty."
</p>

<p>
"Max's?" he suggested, "we'll have snails."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what a perfectly dear place&mdash;in every
sense of the word."
</p>

<p>
"My treat," he said.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"You never dined with me before; you
might let me celebrate.
</p>

<p>
"We'll celebrate anyway, Dutch.  Make it Max's."
</p>

<p>
He didn't prolong the argument.  They had
long before made a compact that the expenses
of their expeditions should be shared.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," he inquired, "your six thirty
really means seven.  I've an appointment,
might keep me till then, unless&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'll meet you on the stroke of half-past,"
she said, and was as good as her word.
</p>

<p>
They had snails <i>à la Max</i>, whereof the
frame is finer than the picture, as well as
Maxian frogs' legs, boned and wrapped in
lettuce leaves, and, not without misgivings,
a bottle of claret.
</p>

<p>
Stevens, unaware that it was their last
time of pretending, abided by the rules.  They
talked shop and shows and vacations.  Georgia
slipped in a few appropriate words concerning
her cultural progress.  They were both
somewhat severe upon the orchestra, because
there was too much noise to the music, so
Mason beckoned the head waiter and
"requested" the barcarole from <i>Tales of
Hoffman</i>, and they floated off in it toward the
edge of what they knew.
</p>

<p>
It is said that most people have at least
two personalities.  In this respect Georgia
was like them.  One side of her was the
woman of 1850, and the times previous;
whether mother, wife, daughter, maiden or
mistress, primarily something in relation to
man, her individuality submerged in this
relationship, as a soldier's individuality is
submerged in his uniform.
</p>

<p>
The other aspect of Georgia's nature was
that of the "new woman," the women hoped
for in 1950.  Bold, determined, taught to
think, relentless in defense of her own
personality, insistent that men shall have less
and she shall have more sexual freedom, she
is first of all herself and only next to that,
something to a man.
</p>

<p>
When the woman of 1850 managed to get
in a word about Jim and his fruitless wait at
home, the woman of 1950 answered, "Shall
you now be absurd enough to leave the man
you love for one you hate?"
</p>

<p>
"Shall we take in a show?" he suggested
when they had finished their coffee.
</p>

<p>
"I believe I'd rather walk home."
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's five miles."  He was somewhat
disconcerted by her energy, for he was
distinctly let down, in reaction from his day's
work, and his afternoon's excitement of looking
forward to an unusual meeting with her,
which had turned out after all to be more
than commonly placid.
</p>

<p>
"Five miles&mdash;and a heavenly night.  The
first of spring.  Come, brace up."
</p>

<p>
"You must be feeling pretty strong."
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, "I am getting a bit headachy,
I want some air, to get out of four walls
and merge into the darkness&mdash;if you know
what I mean."
</p>

<p>
"You're not going to be sick?" he asked
concernedly.
</p>

<p>
"O, no&mdash;it's just a touch of spring fever, I
imagine."
</p>

<p>
There is a cement path with a sloping
concrete breakwater which winds between Lake
Michigan on one side and Lincoln Park on
the other for a distance of several miles.
Here come the people in endless procession
from morning until midnight, two by two,
male and female, walking slow and talking
low, permeated by the souls of children begging life.
</p>

<p>
It is a chamber of Maeterlinck's azure
palace of the unborn.
</p>

<p>
Presently, by good luck, Georgia and her
lover came upon a bench just as another
couple was quitting it&mdash;the supply of benches
being inadequate to the demands of pleasant
evenings in spring.  The departing two
passed, one around each end of the seat, and
walked rapidly, several feet apart, across the
strip of lawn and bridal path beyond.  They
were delayed at the curb by the stream of
automobiles and stood out in clear relief
against the passing headlights.
</p>

<p>
It was evident they had been quarreling,
for the man looked sullen and the woman,
half turned away, shrugged her shoulders to
what he was saying.
</p>

<p>
Georgia had been watching them.  "Too
bad," said she, "they're having a row."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they're not meant for each
other."
</p>

<p>
"Everyone quarrels sometimes," she
answered, "meant or not."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think we would, if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure of it," she replied sharply.
"We're human beings, not angels."
</p>

<p>
There was doubtless common sense in what
she said, but nevertheless it delighted him
not.  He wished that she could in such
moments as these, yield herself fully to the
illusion which possessed him that their life
together would be one sempiternal climax of joy.
</p>

<p>
"I honestly believe," he asserted solemnly,
"that sometimes two natures are so perfectly
adjusted that there is no friction between
them."
</p>

<p>
"Rubbish," she replied, quoting a newly
read Shaw preface, "people aren't meant to
stew in love from the cradle to the grave."
</p>

<p>
She couldn't understand her own mood.
She had arranged this evening with Stevens
to tell him that she was ready to marry him,
and she found herself unable to.  Her
conscious purpose was the same as ever.
</p>

<p>
Yet as often as she summoned herself to
look the look or keep the silence which would
put in train his declaration, it seemed as if
she received from her depths a sudden and
imperative mandate against it.
</p>

<p>
It was her long silence while she was
pondering over these strange things which gave
him a false cue and he entered to the center
of her consciousness.
</p>

<p>
"This wasting of ourselves must go on
until he dies?"
</p>

<p>
"The only way out is death," she said
slowly, "or apostasy."
</p>

<p>
"Apostasy!"  The word had an ugly sound
even for him.
</p>

<p>
"I know one woman who did it for love of
a man."
</p>

<p>
"And she is happy?"
</p>

<p>
Georgia did not answer at once.
</p>

<p>
"And she is happy," he repeated seriously,
as if much depended on the question, "or
not?"
</p>

<p>
"She says she is," she answered, "but I
don't think so.  She doesn't look happy&mdash;about
the eyes&mdash;one notices those things.
She seems changed&mdash;and&mdash;reckless and&mdash;and
she's not always been faithful to her
husband.  I found it out."
</p>

<p>
"You found it out!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she asked me to go to a dinner party.
Her husband was away from town&mdash;there
were four of us&mdash;and I could tell what it
meant.  She wanted me to do what she was
doing&mdash;and we had been friends so long&mdash;we
took our first communion together."
</p>

<p>
"Georgia," he asked, chilled through with
fright, "do you often have that sort of thing
put in your way?"
</p>

<p>
"I have plenty of chances to make a mess
of life," she replied, "every woman does,
who's passable looking, especially downtown
women."
</p>

<p>
"Dearest heart," he begged, "I can't go
on thinking of that the rest of my life.  Marry
me and let me shield and shelter you from all
this&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"This what?"
</p>

<p>
"Temptation," he blurted, "and rotten,
unwomanly down-town life.  A woman ought
to be taken care of, in her own home, by the
man who loves her and respects and honors her."
</p>

<p>
Georgia smiled.  "Do you know," she
asked, "that's almost exactly word for word
the way he talked to this friend of mine and
persuaded her to get her divorce and leave
the Church and marry him&mdash;almost word for
word&mdash;she told me about it at the time.  And
now she's&mdash;fooling him.  It didn't shield
her from temptation."
</p>

<p>
"But I have known people to be divorced
and marry again and live perfectly happy
and respectable lives."
</p>

<p>
"Protestants&mdash;weren't they?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that's the point.  They do what they
think is right, but a Catholic does what she
knows is wrong, and begins her new marriage
in a wilful sin, so what can grow from it but
more sin?"
</p>

<p>
Her voice, naturally full and resonant like
a trained speaker's, was thin and uncertain
as she told of the apostate.  Her other self,
the woman of the past, was ascendant, but she
fought against what she conceived to be a
momentary weakness, and forced her resolution
as a skillful rider forces an unwilling
horse over a jump.  "But if you want me,"
she said in words that trembled, "you can
have me."
</p>

<p>
"If I want you&mdash;&mdash;"  He took her in his
arms and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to her definitely in that instant
that nothing could ever be quite the same
with her again, that a certain fine purity had
passed from her forever and she must live
thereafter on a lower plane.
</p>

<p>
All the modernistic teachings, books,
lectures, pamphlets with which she had in
recent years packed her head, on woman's right
to selfhood, parasitic females, prostitution
in marriage, endowed motherhood, sexual
slavery; and all the practical philosophy of
the success school which she had learned from
years of contact with money-makers, that life
is more for the daring than for the good,
were washed away by the earlier-formed and
deeper-lying impressions of her youth.
</p>

<p>
She was aware of a fleeting return of her
virginal feeling that to give herself to one
man was humbleness sufficient for a lifetime;
but to give herself to two would be the
permanent lowering of pride.
</p>

<p>
But she felt that for her the moving finger
had writ and passed.  There could be no more
going back or shadow of turning.  Henceforth,
for good or evil, she belonged to this man.
</p>

<p>
She yielded to his kisses, as many as he
wished, in passive submission.
</p>

<p>
"You will always be good to me&mdash;promise
that, promise me, dear," she begged,
"because if you're not I'll&mdash;&mdash;"  Her voice
choked and two tears rolled down her cheeks.
Gone was her freedom and her pride.  She
spoke, not as her ideal had been, partner
speaking to partner on even terms, but as a
servant to her master, asking not justice but
mercy.
</p>

<p>
Her solitary happiness in this hour was the
feeling that the man was the stronger, that
despite his greenness and awkwardness and
the ease with which she had hitherto
controlled him, fundamentally his nature was
bigger than hers and that she was compelled
to follow him.  In her new feebleness she
rejoiced that she sinned not boldly and
resolutely, but because she had been taken in the
traditional manner by the overpowering
male.
</p>

<p>
"I have been looking forward to this for
longer than you suspect," said she, "and now
that it's come, I feel as if I were at a play
watching it happen to some one else."
</p>

<p>
He put his hand on her shoulder, then
quickly turned her white face to his.  "Why,
what is the matter?" he asked.  "You are
shaking like a leaf."
</p>

<p>
"I think I'd better go home.  It is damp
and cold sitting here."  After they had gone
a few steps, she said, with a weak little
laugh, "I've lost my enthusiasm for walking.
Put me on the car."
</p>

<p>
He began to be thoroughly frightened.
"Don't worry, dear," she reassured him.
"Nothing can change us now.  We belong to
each other&mdash;for keeps."
</p>

<p>
They said little to each other in the brightly
lighted street car.  She sat slightly crumpled,
her shoulders rounded, swaying to the
stops and starts.  She breathed slowly
through her lips, and her eyes had the
strange wide-open look of a young bird's,
when you hold it in your hands.  And he, but
partly understanding, yearned for her
helplessly, and covenanted with his nameless gods
that no sorrow should ever come to her from
him.
</p>

<p>
She hung to his arm as they walked up the
half-lighted street where she lived, between
rows of three, four and five story flat
buildings full of drama.  Outside her own she
stopped and looked up to her windows.  They
were brightly lighted.
</p>

<p>
Instead of using her key, she rang the bell
to her apartment.  She heard Al's voice in
answer.
</p>

<p>
"Is Jim there?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
She turned to Stevens with a flash of her
old positiveness.
</p>

<p>
"I must go somewhere else.  And I don't
feel like telling my troubles to any friend
to-night.  So will you take me to a hotel?"
</p>

<p>
They returned to the car line by an unusual
street, lest Al should come looking after her,
she driving her sick frame along by sheer
will, her lover resolved that if need be he
would save her from herself.
</p>

<p>
She waited while he engaged her room, and
when he came bringing her key, he said, "I
have put you down as Miss Talbot."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you were nice to think of that.  I
like to imagine sometimes it still is so." She
took his hand.  "Good night, dear," she
whispered.  "I will be a true wife to you."

XV
<br />
MR. SILVERMAN
</h3>

<p>
Stevens called up Georgia's room in the
morning to ask how she had slept and she
reported, "Well&mdash;that is, pretty well," which
wasn't true, for she had tossed wretchedly
through the night.  By careful brushing and
buying a shirtwaist she managed to measurably
freshen her appearance, though she
reached the office with tired eyes and hectic
splotches beneath her eyes.  Al was there
before her waiting with white face.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia," he began miserably, "I've been
hunting the town for you.  Where have you
been?"
</p>

<p>
"Alone."
</p>

<p>
"You've frightened us half to death.
Mother's sick over it."
</p>

<p>
"You can have Jim in the house, or me,
but not both of us."
</p>

<p>
She would give him no more satisfaction,
and he was turning away angry at her
obstinacy, when Mason came up to greet her.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning."
</p>

<p>
"Good morning."
</p>

<p>
Al quickly divined that here was the man.
It was written in the way he looked at her,
and in Georgia's sudden sidelong glance at
Al to see if he saw.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like a word with you," said the brother
to the lover, tapping him on the shoulder
with studied rudeness, "now."
</p>

<p>
Stevens didn't understand the situation,
but he was properly resentful, and lowered
at the stranger.  In these subtle days of
commerce, finger-tips on collar bones may
convey all that was once meant by a glove in
the face.
</p>

<p>
"My brother, Mr. Stevens," she explained.
They did not shake hands.  Mason was not
quite sure from the young fellow's expression
just what might happen, but he was sure
it had better not happen right there.  "Let's
get out of the office&mdash;and you can have as
many words as you want," said he.  Georgia
arose to go with them.
</p>

<p>
"No, don't you come," said Stevens.
</p>

<p>
"I think perhaps it would be better."
</p>

<p>
"But it wouldn't.  You stay here," the
man answered with great positiveness.  She
sank obediently in the chair, to the disgusted
amazement of her brother, and let them go
alone.
</p>

<p>
"Were you out with her last night?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
The lad sunk his hand to his coat pocket,
his wild young brain aflame with violence and
romance and vengeance and the memory of
Moxey's sweetheart's uncle who had slain the
despoiler of his home.  Stevens was near
death and he knew it, but he never batted an
eye as Al reported later to Moxey.
</p>

<p>
"I knew it damned well.  She said she was
alone."  His hand tightened on the automatic,
pressing down the safety lock, and he
pointed the gun, so that he could shoot
through his pocket and kill.
</p>

<p>
"She was, after eleven.  I left her then."
</p>

<p>
"Prove it.  You've got to," insultingly.
</p>

<p>
"Go look at the hotel register, for the name
of Miss Georgia Talbot."
</p>

<p>
Al grunted.  Here was a concrete fact&mdash;subject
to verification, yes or no.  "All right,"
he vouchsafed curtly, "if it turns out that
way&mdash;but one more thing&mdash;keep away from
her after this altogether&mdash;understand."  Al
shot out his jaw and swung around his pocket
with the barrel pointing straight at Stevens'
middle.  He looked just then a good deal like
a young tough delivering a serious threat,
which he was.
</p>

<p>
Stevens shoved his derby hat back and
laughed.  "If you think you can run me
around with the pop-gun, guess again.  I'm
going to marry Georgia and you're coming
to the wedding," he stepped right up to the
gun and tapped Al sharply on the shoulder,
"understand."
</p>

<p>
It was perhaps a chancy thing to do, for
the lad had worked himself into a state of
self-righteous anger, and his vanity was
savagely exulted by the sensation of putting it
over on a full-grown man to his face.  But
Stevens had acted instinctively as he
frequently did in stressful moment and his
instinct played him true this time.
</p>

<p>
"She ain't allowed to marry again, so you
keep off the grass," he answered loudly, but
his voice broke and shot up an octave as he
took his hand from his pocket to clench his
fist and shake it in the other's face.
</p>

<p>
Whereat Stevens knew he had him and answered
quietly in his most matter-of-fact
business tones, "That's for her to say&mdash;and
she's said it."  He smiled.  "You know she's
free, white, and twenty-one."
</p>

<p>
Al, not sure just what his next step ought
to be, walked away, probably to consult with
Moxey, muttering as he went, "Well, remember
I warned you."
</p>

<p>
Stevens returned to the office and explained
the incident briefly to Georgia, "Oh, the kid
was excited at first, but I reassured
him."  While they were talking the old man rang
her buzzer and asked her to have Mr. Stevens
come in.
</p>

<p>
A dark, beaked, heavy-browed, much-dressed
gentleman was in the old man's
office, introduced to Mason as Mr. Silverman.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Silverman deserves a paragraph or
two.  He was said to be a Polish, a Russian
or a Spanish Jew, but nobody knew for sure
or dared ask him, for he didn't like it.  At
sixteen or thereabouts, he came to the
company as an office boy, and in two months was
indispensable.  At thirty-seven, owing partly
to the conscientious performance of his duties
and more to his earnestness in pulling feet
from the rungs above him, and stamping
fingers from the rungs below, he was elected to
a position especially created for him, to-wit,
Executive Secretary to the President of The
Eastern Life Insurance Company of New
York, which gave him everything to say about
the running of it except the very last word.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps once a quarter he was reversed,
and always on some extremely important
matter involving the investment of funds.
This galled him beyond measure, but he kept
it to himself.
</p>

<p>
At the last annual election, he would have
presented himself as a candidate for president,
or at least for first vice-president with
power to act, but after sizing up the way the
proxies were running for the new directorate,
he knew that crowd would never stand for
him, so he squelched his own boom for the
time being, and waited.  The title was
re-conferred for the fifteenth time upon a charming
but delicate plutocrat of the fourth
generation of New Yorkers, who was compelled to
spend his term health-hunting in European
spas, where Mr. Silverman took delight in
sending him for decision a copious stream of
unimportant but vexatiously technical
questions, which much disturbed the invalid's
serenity, for he had entered the company at the
top, and didn't know detail.  Mr. Silverman
himself settled the more important matters,
inasmuch as there wasn't time to send to
Europe and wait for an answer.  Whenever he
reached for a stronger hold, he had an
incontrovertible excuse, and he got to know
Mr. Morgan personally.
</p>

<p>
He was stocky, with ample room for his
digestion, and like most fighting men, he had
a good thick neck that carried plenty of blood
to his head.  His unpleasantest trait was his
shame of race, and his most agreeable one
an understanding love of music.  His only
exercise was strong black cigars, and
everyone on the company's payroll dreaded his
seemingly preternatural knowledge of what
was going on.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Stevens," said he, "sit down.  I have
heard of you."  Then to allow that pregnant
remark to sink in he turned to Georgia.
"Take this, please: 'Mr. W. F. Plaisted,
General Agent in charge S. W. Division,
Eastern Life Insurance Company, Kansas
City, Mo.  Dear Sir: Please furnish the
bearer, Mr. Mason Stevens, with whatever
information he desires.  He is my personal
representative.  With kind regards, Yours
truly, Executive Secretary to the President.'
</p>

<p>
"That is all."  He nodded to Georgia, and
she departed.  The old man pussy-footed
after her, leaving the other two together in
his private office.
</p>

<p>
"You are to take the nine o'clock train
to-night for Kansas City to prepare a report
for me on why we aren't getting more
business in the town and our competitors less.
Here are some letters from New York to
certain banks there which will admit you to their
confidence.  Find out all you can about
Plaisted and his office before you go to him.  Send
me a night letter to my hotel every night as
to your progress.  Use this code."  He took
a typewritten sheet of synonyms from his
pocket.  "Should you cross the trail of
another investigator for the Eastern, you are
not to reveal yourself to him.  This point you
are to bear in mind."  He paused for an answer.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said Stevens.
</p>

<p>
"Your expense money will be liberal; and
mind, no talk&mdash;not even a hint to your best
girl.  I suppose, of course, there is
one."  Mason smiled, but did not answer.  "I am
told you are not married."
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it is just as well.  Women are
to live with, not to travel with, and you're
still traveling."  Mr. Silverman lit a
fifty-center, and then, being a natural-born
commander, topped off his instructions with
hopes of loot.  "Good luck, young man.
You're shaking hands with your future on
this trip."
</p>

<p>
Mason came from the interview consecrated
to the task of getting the goods on
Plaisted.  Going after him was like going
after ivory in Africa.  Landing a prospect
was as tame relatively as plugging ducks on
the Illinois River.  For Plaisted had been a
big man in the company in his day, though
getting a little old now.  With solid
connections through Missouri, Kansas and the
Southwest, if he fell, he'd fall with a smash.
</p>

<p>
Mason rather fancied that in company
politics he could see as far through a
grindstone as his neighbor, if it had a hole in it.
He knew that there was a hidden but bitter
fight for control of the business between the
old New York society crowd who had
inherited it, and the younger abler men, under
the leadership of Silverman, who had grown
up from the ranks.  He knew that his own
boss, the old man, lined up with Silverman,
but that Plaisted had delivered the
south-western proxies in a solid block, for the New
York ticket.  He therefore inferred that
Silverman didn't feel strong enough to remove
Plaisted without a pretty plausible reason
and that he was being sent to Kansas City
to find the reason; and failing that, to make
one, which, as it turned out, was precisely
what he did.
</p>

<p>
He set out on his mission with as little
compunction as a soldier who had received
orders to shoot to kill.  For, as he told
himself, surely Plaisted had also pulled down
men in his time.  Life is a battle.  Therefore
is it not well to be with the conqueror and
share in the cut?
</p>

<p>
If he could now make good with Silverman,
and, more especially, convince him that he
was a live one who would keep on making
good, the Jew would certainly recognize him
in the reorganization.  He had visions of
tooling along the macadam in his Panno Six to
a vined house in the suburbs, hidden by tall
trees, where, in a trailing gown, Georgia
would walk through her flowers to meet him,
with a small hand clinging to each of hers.
</p>

<p>
Plaisted had now become, to all intents and
purposes, his competitor; and going after
your competitors is the life of trade.  As for
Mrs. Plaisted&mdash;if there was one&mdash;who was
she against Georgia?
</p>

<br />
GEORGIA LEAVES HOME
</h3>

<p>
He expected to be gone several weeks, so
Georgia telephoned the janitor to tell mama
that she would stay down for dinner, again,
but would be home soon afterwards.  Mason
took her to the top of a tall building, where
there was a sixty cent table d'hote.  The
topic, of course, was his forthcoming trip
from routine to adventure and its probable
effect upon their fortunes.
</p>

<p>
For all the wise saws about not talking to
women, one may hardly dine with his fiancée
of a day without mention of the marvelous
opportunity which dropped before one that
morning as from the skies.  Especially if she
is in the same business and heard it drop.
</p>

<p>
So, little by little, one thing leading to
another, he told her everything he knew or
guessed or hoped.  He did not once forget
Silverman's injunction to silence, as he
babbled on.  It stuck in his mind like a thorn in
the foot; and, telling himself he was a fool
to talk, he talked.  The precise moment didn't
seem to come when he could frankly say,
without offense, "Georgia, that part of it is
a secret."  And he didn't see how to
temporize widely, for it had become physically
impossible for him to lie to her, though, of
course, he retained the use of his faculties
for commerce with others.
</p>

<p>
So he passed on the ever heavy load of
silence, hoping that she could hold her tongue
if he couldn't.  It was as much her affair as
his anyway, so he felt, and if by her indiscretion
she should cut him out of Silverman's
confidence and future big things, she would in
the same motion cut herself out of a Panno
Six and a house in the trees and a richer
circle of friends.
</p>

<p>
But, inasmuch as she was a case-hardened
private secretary, she kept her faith with
him in this thing at least.  If he never has
a Panno Six it wasn't her fault.
</p>

<p>
The most surprising thing to her in his
narrative was that it did not more greatly
interest her.  It seemed to her a far-off affair,
impersonal, like something she was reading
in the papers.  Stevens seemed to stand
outside her area of life, which had become
narrow and curiously uneasy, heavy with a
future in which he was not concerned.
</p>

<p>
At first he attributed the listlessness, which
she tried to conceal but could not, to one of
the widely advertised feminine moods, and
he tried his best to divert her not merely with
pictures of their future, blissful and automobileful,
but also with quips and cranks and
wanton wiles.  No go.
</p>

<p>
So when course VI of the table d'hote&mdash;nuts
and pecans, three of each to the order&mdash;was
ended, he suggested that perhaps she would
better go directly home instead of waiting
downtown with him until his train went.  She
acquiesced.  They walked to the "L" in
silence.
</p>

<p>
Imagine the chagrin of a knight riding off
to the bloody wars from a ladye who didn't
care if he never came back.  That was how
it struck him.  She took his arm to climb the
steep iron stairs, and at the top stopped a
moment to get her breath.
</p>

<p>
"Dear heart," she said, "don't have all
those awful thoughts about me&mdash;don't you
suppose I know what you're thinking?  I've
been dull to-night, but my head is simply
splitting.  I believe I'm in for the grip."
</p>

<p>
He looked at his watch.  "I'm sure I can
take you home and get back in time."
</p>

<p>
"Bather than have you risk it, I'll stay
down until your train goes."
</p>

<p>
"Promise me then to get a doctor and go
right to bed."
</p>

<p>
"I'll go right to bed&mdash;I can barely hold my
head up, and I'll get a doctor in the morning
if I'm not better."
</p>

<p>
There were only two or three other people
on the long platform, so he kissed her good-bye.
Then the screened iron gate was slapped
to behind her, the guard jerked his cord, she
smiled weakly and waved her hand back at
him, and it was all over for a much longer
time than he had any idea of.
</p>

<p>
He watched her train until the tail lights
turned the loop, then said "Hell," lit a cigar,
pushed his hat back, sighed and went to check
his trunk.
</p>

<p>
He sat up in the smoking compartment
gassing with drummers until the last of them
turned in, sympathized for awhile with the
Pullman porter, who suffered volubly as soon
as Mason gave him permission to.  He had
been married that very afternoon and now
he was off to Los Angeles and back, a
ten-day journey, leaving behind him as a dark
and shining mark for those who realized the
devilishness of his itinerary an unprotected,
young, gay-hearted bride.  He appreciated
the snares that would be set for her by his
brothers of brush and berth.  He'd been a
bachelor himself.  "Yas, sah, railroadin' is
sure one yalla dawg's life for a fambly
man."
</p>

<p>
Stevens lay awake a long time that night
thinking of the future, and Georgia lay
awake a long time considering the past.  She
felt hot and thirsty; three or four times she
got out of bed and ran the faucet until the
water was cold and bathed her face and
drank.
</p>

<p>
After she had left Stevens she had taken a
cross seat in the car facing homeward, and,
placing her burning cheek against the window
for coolness, had dozed off for many stations.
When she awoke with a start at the one
beyond her own, her personality had slipped to
its earlier center as definitely as when a
clutch slips from high to second speed.
</p>

<p>
It is said that the last step gained by the
individual or the race is the first step lost,
in sickness, age and fear.  So Georgia's
illness began its attack on the topmost layer of
her character, that part of it which had been
built in the recent years.  She was driven,
as it were, to a lower floor of her own edifice
and no longed saw so wide a view.
</p>

<p>
Her pride and self-will crumbled&mdash;for the
sick aren't proud&mdash;and her modernity trickled
away.  After all, was it not more peaceful
to do what people thought you ought to,
than to fight them constantly for your own
way?  Life was too short and human nature
too weak for the stress and strain of such
ceaseless resistance as she had made in the
past few years against her family, the friends
of her family, and the Church.  For God's
sake let her now have peace.
</p>

<p>
Yes, for God's sake.  The words had come
irreverently to her mind.  But after all, could
she or anyone else have peace except from
God? and was there any other gift as sweet?
</p>

<p>
She knew there was one sure anodyne for
her troubled spirit, and only one&mdash;the
confessional.  She had kept away too long
already, for more than two years.  She would
go to-morrow, or perhaps the next day, and
wash her soul clean.  Father Hervey would
talk to her as if to rip her heart strings out,
but in the end he would leave her with peace,
after she had promised and vowed to give up
her mortal sin.  Poor Mason, that meant him.
She wept a few weak tears, then dried her
eyes on the corner of the sheet.
</p>

<p>
So this was to be the end of her spiritual
adventuring, the end of the free expression
of her free being, and selfhood, and all those
other valorous things she had rejoiced in.
</p>

<p>
She wasn't able any longer to go on with
it.  She must desert the army of women in
the day of battle, the army led by Curie, Key,
Pankhurst, Schreiner, Addams, Gilman, and
cross over to the adversary, the encompassing
Church.  It would absorb her into its vast
unity as a drop disappears in the sea.  It
would think for her and will for her.  She
would be animated with its life, not her own;
but it would suffuse her with the comfort
that is past understanding.  She would eat
the lotus and submit.  She was not strong,
like great people.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the priest would suggest her return
to Jim.  But that wasn't in the law.  He
could only suggest and urge it.  He could
not insist on it.  She couldn't go back to Jim,
she couldn't, she couldn't.  She sobbed as if
there were a presence in the room which she
hoped to move by her tears.
</p>

<p>
A clear vision of her husband came before
her, as she had often seen him, sitting on
the edge of this very bed, in undershirt and
trousers, leaning forward, breathing abominably
loud, his paunch sagging, unlacing his
shoes.  Right or wrong, good or bad, heaven
or hell, that was one sight the priest should
never make her see again.  She hated Jim
and loathed him forever.
</p>

<p>
As she was dressing next morning she
called to Al to please go down and telephone
for the doctor, for she knew she could never
go through the day's work without medicine.
</p>

<p>
Presently Dr. Randall bowled up, a jolly
stout man, smiling gayly and crinkling up
the corners of his eyes, though he had slept
just eight hours in the last seventy-two.  The
family was glumly finishing breakfast when
he came.  Throughout the meal Mrs. Talbot
had been burningly aware of the contrast
between decent, self-respecting women with a
thought to themselves, and brazen young
fly-by-nights in thin waists, who run after men
and make themselves free; but she threw only
a few pertinent remarks into the atmosphere,
because the poor girl was so evidently out of
sorts, with her high color and not touching a
bite of food.  Indeed, a body could hardly
help feeling sorry for her, for all her wicked
pride of will; very likely this sickness was a
judgment on her for it.
</p>

<p>
When Dr. Randall had considered her
pulse, her temperature and her tongue, and
asked half a dozen questions, he told Al to
send for a carriage and take her immediately
to Columbus Hospital.
</p>

<p>
"Why, doctor," exclaimed Mrs. Talbot,
terrorized, "is it anything serious?"
</p>

<p>
"Typhoid&mdash;I'll go telephone to let 'em
know you're coming."
</p>

<p>
The doctor departed and Mrs. Talbot took
Georgia on her lap and crooned over her
until the carriage came.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
XVII
<br />
THE LIGHT FLICKERS
</h3>

<p>
It was decided that Georgia was to have
a bed in a ward at eight dollars a week.
Private rooms were twenty-five and they
couldn't afford that during the month she
would be laid up, particularly since her pay
would stop automatically after her third day
of absence.  The office rule was very strict
on that point.
</p>

<p>
She sat limply in the waiting room while Al
was attending to her registration and her
mother was upstairs with the nurse unpacking
her things.  On the opposite wall were a
couple of windows, sharply framing vistas
into the park across the street, and she saw
two fragments of the path where she had
often walked on Sunday mornings with
Stevens.
</p>

<p>
It was this same wall in front of her which
had seemed so sullen gray and prison-color
from the other side and which had sometimes
turned their talk to sombre things&mdash;death
and immortality.  From the inside, as she
now saw it, the wall was not gray but cheerfully
reddish brown, patterned vertically like
a thrasher's wing.
</p>

<p>
Two pictures hung by the window, of the
pope and of Frances Xavier Cabrini, founder
of the order of nuns that conducted the
hospital.  They were photographs, she thought,
or reproductions from photographs.
</p>

<p>
She looked closely at them, first at the old
man, then at the old woman.  She saw in
them more than she had ever seen in such
pictures before.  They offered at least one
positive answer to the riddle, perhaps the
safest answer for such as she&mdash;to submit
oneself through one's lifetime so as to attain
at the end of it the matchless serenity of
those two untroubled faces.
</p>

<p>
It came to her then in a moment of more
than natural revelation, as it seemed, that
she must seek the peace which these two had
found.
</p>

<p>
She crossed slowly to the desk in the corner,
to write what she knew might be the last
of the thousands of letters she had written.
</p>

<p>
<i>My dear</i>, she began on the hospital paper,
<i>I am here with</i>, not to cause him anxiety in
the beginning of his great enterprise, <i>a touch
of the grip.  Nothing serious.  In haste and
headache.  Georgia.</i>
</p>

<p>
She paused.  Even if it must end by her
giving him up, she loved him.  Should she,
by an omission so significant, upset and
distress him and perhaps hinder him in a task
which, well performed, would bring great
things to him, if never now to her!  <i>I love
you</i>, she added, <i>always</i>.
</p>

<p>
A second note she dated a week forward.
<i>My dear, I haven't pulled around again as
soon as I expected, but the rest has done me
a world of good.  Don't worry about me&mdash;they
say I've a constitution like a horse.  For
my sake, make good, Mason&mdash;you've got to.
With love, lots of it, always, G.</i>
</p>

<p>
A third she put two weeks ahead.  <i>Dearest,
I'm doing fine and will be out soon now.  Your
letters have been such a comfort.  It's almost
two thousand years since we've seen each
other, isn't it?  I love you, dear.  Georgia.</i>
</p>

<p>
She put them in their envelopes, addressed
them, and wrote 1, 2 and 3 respectively in
the upper right hand corners in such a way
that the stamps would conceal them.  Al
came in as she was finishing, and she
explained how she wanted them mailed a week
apart.  At first he refused, but at last was
over-persuaded by her misery.  He promised
to do her errand as she asked, and kept his
promise faithfully.
</p>

<p>
A page boy chanting "Mis-ter Stev-uns,
Mis-ter Riggle-hei-murr, Mis-ter An-droo
Brown, Mis-ter Noise, Mis-ter Stevuns,"
caught Mason in the grill paying a lot of
attention to a first vice-president over a
planked tenderloin, German fried and large
coffee.  Accordingly he made his first report
not to Silverman, but to the old man, thus:

<p>
The old man himself had not been entirely
immune to Georgia's charm, although in the
office and before him she had steadily veiled
her personality behind her status as a precise,
prompt and well-lubricated appanage of a
Standard Typewriter No. 4.  So it was only a
well subdued charm that the old man sensed
in her, stimulating as a small glass of syrupy
liqueur.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him pathetic that the silent,
presentable, self-respecting young woman, to
whom for over a year now he had been
revealing his most private, money-making
thoughts almost as fast as they came to him,
might never smile him another "good morning,"
agree with him pleasantly that it was
hot or cold or wet, and get rapidly to work
on his business.
</p>

<p>
She was so accustomed to his ways, and he
hated the thought of breaking in another
one&mdash;but, damn it, that wasn't all by any means,
he liked the girl on her own account&mdash;she
was such a little lady.
</p>

<p>
The old man did some rapid telephoning
and was able to answer Stevens' wire half
an hour after he got it.

The old man naturally supposed that
Mason knew the nature of Georgia's illness
and was trying to reassure him, in a kindly
way, that as typhoid cases go it was only
a very little one.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the old man, if he was a little lax
later on in wiring all the developments in the
case&mdash;because he didn't want to frighten the
young man into throwing up his investigation
in the very middle of it&mdash;was more valuably
helpful in another way.
</p>

<p>
When the fever reached its crisis he got a
great specialist out of bed for a three o'clock
in the morning consultation over the little
stenographer, and charged his costly loss of
sleep to the company instead of to Mason
Stevens, Mr. Silverman cordially approving.
</p>

<p>
They said afterwards that Georgia could
not have taken another small step toward
death, without dying.  She flickered and
guttered like a lamp whose oil has been used up.
For a few moments it seemed that her light
had been put out altogether, but there must
have been a tiny spark hidden somewhere in
the charred wick, for the doctors brought her
back by artificial stimulation, and you can
not stimulate the dead.
</p>

<p>
If specialists and private rooms and nurses
give sick people more chance of getting well,
then Stevens and the old man and Mr. Silverman
saved Georgia by their care of her, for
she could not have had less chance to live
and lived.

XVIII
<br />
THE PRIEST
</h3>

<p>
The crisis of the fever came upon Georgia
so suddenly that she had lapsed into
semi-consciousness before the arrival of Father
Hervey.  She was able, in making her confession
to him, barely to gasp out a few broken
sentences of contrition.
</p>

<p>
He anointed with holy oil her eyes, ears,
nostrils, lips, hands and feet, absolving her
in the name of the Trinity from those sins
which she truly repented.
</p>

<p>
When at last she came out of the shadow,
her mother believed that it was the priest
even more than the doctors who had saved
her, for it is taught that the reception of
Extreme Unction may restore health to the body
when the same is beneficial to the soul.
</p>

<p>
A few days later the priest came again
to see her and was amazed at the rapidity
of her convalescence.
</p>

<p>
"You're out of the woods this time, Georgia,"
he said, "sure enough.  But I can tell
you you had us frightened."  He spoke with
just the barest shade of a tip of a brogue,
too slight to indicate in print.
</p>

<p>
His coat was shiny, his trousers slightly
frayed at the bottom, and his shoes had been
several times half-soled.  A parish priest,
throughout his life he had kept to the vow
of personal poverty as faithfully as a Jesuit.
</p>

<p>
He stayed for half an hour and made
himself charming.  He asked the nurse not to
leave the room, saying that he needed an
audience.  He had some new stories, he said,
and he wanted to test them, which he couldn't
do on Georgia alone, she was so solemn.
Besides, she was almost sure to hash them up
in repeating them, and he had a reputation
to preserve.  There was a shepherd in County
Clare whose wife was from County Mayo,
with the head of the color of a fox, inside and
out.  And so forth.
</p>

<p>
First the women smiled with him, then
laughed, then roared.  His touch was sure,
his shading delicate, his technique perfected.
He had them and he held them.  It was
excellent medicine for the sick he gave them.
</p>

<p>
Then he told them a little parish gossip
of wedding banns he thought he would shortly
be requested to publish.  His eyes twinkled
at Georgia's astonished "You don't
say&mdash;well, what she sees in him&mdash;&mdash;"  And he
finished his pleasant visit with a couple of
little anecdotes, each with a moral subtly
introduced; simple tales of heroism and
self-sacrifice that had lately come under his
notice.
</p>

<p>
When he arose to go Georgia and the nurse
bent their heads.  He offered a short little
prayer, gave them his blessing and departed.
</p>

<p>
He had not said a word in a serious way to
Georgia of her affairs.  But she knew that
he was merely postponing.
</p>

<p>
Before his decisive interview with her he
prayed earnestly for strength; for strength
rather than guidance, for he felt no shade
of doubt that the path which he would urge
her to take was the right one.  The Church
had pointed it out long ago, and that settled
it.  He never questioned the wisdom or the
inspiration of the great policies of the
Church.  He was none of your modernists,
questioners and babblers; he was a veteran
soldier, a fighting private in the army which
will make no peace but a victor's.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia," he began, "do you feel strong
enough for a serious talk?  For if you don't
I will come later."
</p>

<p>
She was sitting up in bed.  Her skin had
the translucent pallor of one whose life has
hung in the balance.  Her hair, braided and
coiled about her head, had lost its peculiar
gloss and become dry and brittle.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Father; I am strong enough.  As
well have it over with now as any time."
</p>

<p>
There was more of defiance in her words
than in her heart, for she could not help
being a little afraid of this gentle, gray old
man with the Roman collar.  Since her
childhood he had stood in her mind for strange
power and mystery.  Even in her most
rebellious days before her sickness she had not
been willing to confront him.  She had evaded
him, run away from him.  Now she could not
run away.
</p>

<p>
"I have seen Jim since I was here last,"
said he, "and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Father, I know what you're going to
say&mdash;and a reconciliation is impossible.
</p>

<p>
"You know that he has stopped drinking?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I heard so."
</p>

<p>
"It is true.  He looks fine, fine.  Brown
and strong."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't think he ever could do it," said
she, shaking her head.  "He is fighting a
battle he has lost so often."
</p>

<p>
"There is none who could help him so much
in his struggle as you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there," she answered quickly and
bitterly, "I think you are mistaken.  He has
paid very little attention to me or my wishes
for four or five years past."
</p>

<p>
"Then," said the priest, "he has learned
his lesson, for now he depends on you more
than on any other person."
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, but closed her eyes and
clenched her fists as tightly as she could,
summoning her will to resist.  But she realized
that her will, like her body, was not in health.
The sick bed is the priest's harvest time.
</p>

<p>
"My child," he said gently, "there is a
human soul struggling for its salvation.  Will
you help or hinder it?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not think that is quite a fair way
to put it."
</p>

<p>
"Not fair?  With all my soul I believe it
to be true.  And, remember, in helping him
to his salvation you are bringing your own
nearer."
</p>

<p>
"But must we consider everything, everything
from the standpoint of salvation?  Of
course, I want to go to Heaven when I die,
but I want to be as happy as I can here on
earth, too.  And that's impossible if I live
with Jim."
</p>

<p>
"If you had a child," he asked patiently,
as if going clear back to the beginning again
with a pupil that could not learn easily, "and
he said to you, 'Mother, I don't want to go
to school, for it makes me unhappy and I
want to be as happy as I can,' would you
let him have his way?"  He paused, but she
did not answer, so he went on to make his
point clearer.  "Of course you wouldn't if
you loved your child.  You would make him
undergo discipline and accept instruction, if
you wanted him to be a fine, strong, brave
man.  Our life on earth is but our school
days&mdash;our preparation for the greater life to
come.  And we are not always allowed to
seek immediate happiness any more than
little children are."
</p>

<p>
She felt that she was being overcome in
argument by the priest, as everyone must be
who accepts his fundamental premise, namely,
that he is more intimately acquainted with
the secrets of life and death than laymen are.
</p>

<p>
But far below the reach of argument and
theological dialectics, which are surface
things, from the deep springs of her life the
increasing warning flowed up to her
consciousness that it was the abomination of a
slave to embrace where she did not love.
</p>

<p>
"Father," she said, not trying to argue
any longer, but just to make him see, "Oh,
don't you understand?  Man and wife are so
close together&mdash;like that."  She placed her
two palms together before her in the attitude
of prayer.
</p>

<p>
He raised his hand solemnly, to pronounce
that phrase which perhaps more than any
other has influenced human destinies, "<i>And
they shall be two in one flesh</i>."
</p>

<p>
"But to live so close with a man you don't
love or care for, oh, that is vile, utterly,
utterly vile."
</p>

<p>
He could not entirely sympathize with the
intensity of her point of view.  If one's
earthly love did not turn out as well as the dreams
of it, in that it merely resembled other phases
of mortal existence, to be submitted to.  He
knew many married couples that fell out at
times, but if they tried to make the best of
things as they were, on the whole they got
along pretty well.  He was inclined to
deprecate the modern tendency to invest with too
much dignity the varying shades of erotic
emotion.  It was one of the things which led
to divorce&mdash;this beatification of earthly,
fleshly love.
</p>

<p>
Had not the highest and holiest lives been
led in the entire absence of it, by its
ruthless extirpation?  Not merely saints, martyrs
and great popes, but ordinary priests like
himself, ordinary nuns like the hospital
sisters, had yielded up that side of life freely
and been the better for it, more single-minded
in the service of the Lord.
</p>

<p>
He did not believe that a woman who had
met with disappointment in this regard
should make of it such a monument of woe.
Let her contemplate her position with a little
more courage and resignation; let her not
exaggerate the importance of her own
personal feelings; let her yield up her pride and
stubbornness and essay to do her duty in
that relationship which she had chosen for
herself, with the sanction of the Church.
</p>

<p>
Father Hervey had sat in a confessional
box for nearly fifty years.  He knew a very
great deal about marriage from without.  He
had seen its glories and its shames reflected
in the hearts of thousands.  But he never felt
its meanings in his own heart, at first hand.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps if its priesthood were not celibate,
the Roman Church would not so unyieldingly
insist upon the indissolubility of marriage.
But if its priesthood were not celibate, the
Roman Church would almost surely lose
much of its grip upon the imagination.  The
mind of the average laymen, Catholic or not,
cannot but be powerfully moved by the
spectacle of a body of educated men, leaders in
their communities, voluntarily renouncing the
most appealing of human relationships for
the sake of a supernatural ideal.
</p>

<p>
It is because the average man does not and
cannot live without women which causes him
to regard a priest with a species of awe.
Reason as you will about it, justify the
married clergy with the words of St. Paul and
God's promptings within us, the fact remains
that the Roman priest alone does what we
can't do, lives as we couldn't live; he alone
demonstrates that he is of somewhat different
clay; he alone mystifies us; and mystery is
the essence of sacerdotalism and authority.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia," resumed Father Hervey, "if
all your pretty dreams have not come true,
remember they never do in this life.  You
must learn to compromise."
</p>

<p>
"I will compromise, Father&mdash;that I will do,
but I won't surrender utterly."  She drew
herself straighter up in bed, leaning forward
without the prop of the pillow.  Her
excitement seemed to invigorate her.  "There is
another man&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Another man?" he asked sternly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I will give him up.  I love him,
but I will give him up.  On the other side, I
will never take Jim back.  That is my
compromise."
</p>

<p>
"Is that not something like saying you
would not commit murder, but would
compromise on stealing?"
</p>

<p>
"Father, that is the best I can do."
</p>

<p>
"If he continued in his former evil ways,"
and there was an unusual tone of pleading
rather than command in Father Hervey's
voice, "I would not urge you to return to
him.  It is recognized that there are cases
where living apart is advisable.  But here is
poor Jim, doing his best and needing every
helping hand, and you won't extend yours.  It
is not fair, Georgia, and it is not kind&mdash;to
him or to yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I can't go back to him, Father.  It is
impossible.  I hate him when I think of it.  I
can't live with him again.  It is inconceivable.
It is a horror to imagine."  She averted
her head and put her hands before her as
if pushing away the image of her husband.
</p>

<p>
"In the top drawer of the bureau," she
said, "you will find some letters&mdash;one for
every day I have been here.  They are from
the other man.  You may take them if you
wish&mdash;and I will give you my promise to
receive no more from him."
</p>

<p>
The priest felt as if he were touching
unclean things when he took up Stevens'
letters.  There were more than twenty of them,
and most of them were very thick.
</p>

<p>
"You have read them all?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
Father Hervey wrapped and tied the letters
in a newspaper and rang for an attendant.
</p>

<p>
"Kindly put this package in the furnace,"
he directed, "just as it is, without undoing it."
</p>

<p>
"You have wandered far," he said quietly,
then took up his soft black hat and departed
without prayer or blessing.
</p>

<p>
She sank back among her pillows, exhausted
from the conflict.  She had won, she told
herself, she had won, but it was without joy.
</p>

<p>
She had definitely given up Mason, as she
knew she must from the beginning of her
sickness, from the day that she entered the
hospital.  Perhaps that had been part of the
price of her getting well.
</p>

<p>
But she had also stuck to her purpose about
Jim.  She had refused to violate her natural
feelings to the extent of entering into life's
deepest intimacies with the one person in all
the world whom she most disliked.  She had
put her will against the priest, the holy man,
and she had not given in.  She knew that
not many women could have done that so
openly and so successfully.
</p>

<p>
He had left her without prayer or blessing.
She was not at peace with the Church
which meant&mdash;her eyes fell upon the sacred
picture on the wall opposite&mdash;which meant
that she was not at peace with The Man
whose mournful sufferings and woe had been
for her.
</p>

<p>
Fear slowly came over her.
</p>

<h3>
XIX
<br />
SACRED HEART
</h3>

<p>
The picture which she saw on the wall
opposite, across the foot of the bed, was of
the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
</p>

<p>
It was the thing which she had seen oftenest
and looked at longest since she had been
in the hospital.  It hung directly before her
eyes as she lay in bed with her head on the
pillow.  She saw it first on waking and last
before sleeping.  Sometimes when she awoke
suddenly in the middle of the night she could
feel the picture still there, watching her in
the darkness with mournful eyes.
</p>

<p>
When first she looked at it she realized
how crude it was in execution.  Its colors
were glaring.  The Man wore a shining white
cloak which he drew back to show underneath
a blue garment.  On this, placed apparently
on the outside of it, was a Sacred Heart of
red, girt in thorns.  Holy flames proceeded
from it, and there was a nimbus of encircling
light.
</p>

<p>
She saw that it would have been better if
the Sacred Heart had seemed to glow through
His garment, instead of being obviously
superposed upon it; that softer blue and
grayer white and less scarlet red would
have been truer tones for a religious picture.
She took not a little pride in her critical
perceptiveness.
</p>

<p>
But as she lay watching the picture day
after day, she appreciated the superficiality
of her first judgment of it.  She had been
looking at colored inks and the marks made
by copper plates, not at a symbol of eternity.
</p>

<p>
Does one estimate a put-by baby's slipper,
or a lock of someone's hair, or a wedding
ring by its intrinsic worth?  If the west side
print shop which made the picture before her
had failed, it could have done nothing else
with that subject to portray.  All attempts
to represent Christ must fail.  Rafael had
failed.  Everyone would fail.
</p>

<p>
Even the Church had failed.  There had
been bad popes, had there not?  But the
Church had tried to represent Him.  The
Church had come nearer to doing so than any
other enginery or person.  The saintliest
persons had belonged to her and died for her
and in her.
</p>

<p>
One Church, she knew, He had founded,
and left behind Him.  One and but one.
"Thou art Peter and on this rock I will build
my church."  It was unequivocal.  Christ did
not say "churches," He said "church."  There
was but one which He had built.
</p>

<p>
And she had defied it; she had hardened
her heart against it; she had sent away its
appointed minister in order to exalt herself.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were drawn again to the Sacred
Heart, bound in the thorns which she and hers
had placed there.  So it had been, so it would
be.  Christ was crucified again each day, in
the hearts of the people whom He loved.  Had
she not herself also given Him vinegar upon
a sponge?
</p>

<p>
She felt the tears trickling down her cheeks
as she thought of her own supreme selfishness,
and she looked through blurred eyes at
the representation of the most supremely
unselfish face that mankind has been able to
conceive.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly divine forgiveness seemed
to descend upon her and level the bounds and
limits of her ego; the barriers of her nature
gave way and she found herself at one with
all creation; she, and humanity, and nature,
and God were together.  Her soul seemed to
quicken itself within her and ineffable light
shone about her.
</p>

<p>
She fell on her knees at her bedside, her
adoring eyes upon the pictured countenance
of her Savior.  Over and over again she
repeated that wonderful word learned at the
convent, which expresses all prayer in itself.
"Peccavi," she prayed, "peccavi, peccavi."
</p>

<p>
It seemed to her at last, when she arose
from her knees that she had washed all her
sins away with the passion of her contrition;
that she had been born again in the spirit
and become pure.  In her ecstasy she thought
that the face of her dear Lord regarded her
now less mournfully, and that there was joy
in His smile where there had been only sorrow.
</p>

<p>
She knew for the first time in her self-willed
life the peace unspeakable of entire
self-surrender.  Her tears continued, but they
were tears of joy, and she sobbed as
sometimes prisoners sob when pardoned
unexpectedly.  The miracle of deliverance rolled
over her soul like a flood, washing away the
barriers of self-control.
</p>

<p>
During her weeks in the hospital she had
lived in an atmosphere of perfect faith, as
intense and vital, almost, as that of the
middle ages.  Those who had carried and
comforted her through her sickness, nurses and
gentle nuns, could not doubt that Christ had
died to save them and to save her.
</p>

<p>
She was environed with Catholicism.
Sometimes she could see through her partly
opened door a black-coated priest passing in
the hall to shrive a dying sinner.  The chimes
and chants from the chapel came faintly to
her ears with benediction.  The picture of
the Sacred Heart hung before her eyes in
unceasing reminder of the whole marvelous
fabric of the Church.
</p>

<p>
Because of her lowered vitality and her
days of idleness in bed, her receptivity to
exterior impressions was greatly increased.
The steady stream of suggestions of her
ancient religion which had flowed in upon
her welled higher and higher in her
subconsciousness until they crossed the line of
consciousness and took sudden and complete
possession of her mind.

SURRENDER
</h3>

<p>
The next morning Georgia sent for Jim.
</p>

<p>
Before he came she wrote to Stevens:
</p>

<p class="letter">
<i>Dear Mason&mdash;I am going to take my
husband back.  I have been here now for nearly
a month, and I have had plenty of time to
think things over, you may be sure.  What I
am going to do is best for both of us&mdash;for
all three of us.  There is no doubt of that in
my mind.  I know it.</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">
<i>Please don't answer or try to see me.  That
would simply make things harder for us, but
not change my plans.</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">
<i>It is my religion that has done it, Mason.
Do you remember that I once told you, when
it came to the big things I didn't believe I
would dare disobey?  I was right in this
respect that I can't bring myself to disobey,
but it is not so much from fear as I thought
it would be.  It is a sense of "ought."  That
is the only way I can put it.  I have a
feeling, tremendously strong, but hard to define
in words, that I ought not, that I must not
go on with what we planned.</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">
<i>This feeling is stronger than I am, Mason.
That is all I can say about it.</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">
<i>So good-bye.  May God bless you and make
you prosperous and happy in this life and the
next one.  This is my prayer, my dear.</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">
<i>Georgia.</i>
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The nurse took the letter to the mail box
in the office and when she returned, looked
at her patient curiously, saying, "Your
husband is waiting downstairs to see you."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mind asking him to come up,
nurse?"
</p>

<p>
Jim, who had now been in the city for a
month, had lost some of his open-air tan
and regained a portion of his banished
poundage, but still he looked far better than
Georgia had seen him for years.  He made
a favorable impression upon her from the
instant he crossed the threshold.  He was the
Jim of the earlier rather than of the later
years of their married life.  His aspect
seemed to confirm the truth of the revelation
which she had received concerning him.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do," she asked formally.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, thank you," he replied.  "How
do you do?"
</p>

<p>
"Much better&mdash;won't you be seated?"
</p>

<p>
Jim, first carefully placing his brown derby
hat under the chair, sat where the priest had
been the day before.
</p>

<p>
She felt a certain numbness of emotion as
she looked at him, but none of that loathing
and disgust without which, as she had come
to believe, he could not be in her presence.
Doubtless, she reflected, she had exaggerated
her dislike for Jim, to justify herself for
Stevens.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia," said Jim slowly, "I didn't act
right before.  I know it and I'm sorry and
ashamed.  It was drink that put the devil
in me, same as it will for any man that goes
against it hard enough........  Some people
can drink in moderation&mdash;it doesn't seem to
hurt them.  But I can't.  When I got started
I tried to drink up all the whiskey in North
Clark Street.  Well, it can't be done.  I'm
onto that now.  No more moderate drinking
for me.  From now on I'm going to chop it
out altogether."
</p>

<p>
He paused for a word of encouragement,
but she remained silent.  A little nodule of
memory, which had been lying dormant in
her brain, awoke at his words, "from now
on I'm going to chop it out altogether."  How
many times she had heard him say that
before&mdash;and every time he had thumped his
right fist into his left palm, just as he was
doing now.
</p>

<p>
"All I ask from you is another chance,"
he continued.  "You know about the prodigal
son.  That's me.  I've come back repentant.
I know I've brought you misery in my time&mdash;and
plenty of it.  So if you stick on your
rights and never forgive me, you don't have
to.  What do you say, Georgia?"
</p>

<p>
Again he paused, but she did not speak,
sitting with her head bent, picking with her
fingers at the coverlet.
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't me that did you the harm,"
he pleaded, "it was the whiskey in me, and
if I keep away from that why the rest of me
isn't so bad.  You used to think that yourself
once, Georgia."
</p>

<p>
She waited for him to continue, fearing
what he would say next, and he said it.  "But
if you're through with me, I guess the only
friend I've got left after all is whiskey.  He
put me to the bad all right, but he won't go
back on me now I'm there.  Whatever else
you can say about him, he's faithful.  He's
always got a smile for you when you're blue,
and he'll stick to you clear through to the
finish."
</p>

<p>
Yes, that was Jim of old, word for word
and motive for motive, who thought the
proper remedy for disappointment was
drunkenness.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jim," she cried, "why did you say that?"
</p>

<p>
He misunderstood her completely.  He felt
that he was making a most effective threat.
"I said it because it's true," he answered
roughly, "that's why.  You've showed me
where I stand&mdash;you've given me my answer
just as loud as if you'd been shouting it.
Good-bye.  Likely I'll be laying up in a barrel
house on the river front pretty soon, and
pretty soon after that they'll be taking me
out to Dunning and planting me in the ground
with just a little stick and a number on it,
or else&mdash;" a catch came into his voice as
the pathetic picture swam vividly before his
eyes, for like most drunkards he possessed
something of the artistic temperament, "or
else maybe they'll cut me up to show the
young internes and the trained nurses which
side the heart's on."
</p>

<p>
Yes, he was doing the baby act again,
making excuses and threatening suicide.  He
might have deceived Al and Father Hervey
for a month or more with his "reform," but
he couldn't deceive her for ten consecutive
minutes.  She had seen into the core of his
nature, that it was weak and unstable as
ever.  Sooner or later he would relapse.
What had been would be again.
</p>

<p>
He arose as if to leave, then hesitated to
give her one last chance to relent.
</p>

<p>
"S'long," he said, slowly opening the door.
</p>

<p>
"You can come home, Jim&mdash;if you want."
</p>

<p>
"If I want!"  He went to her quickly and
took her in his arms and pressed his lips to
her cold ones until she shuddered in his
embrace.
</p>

<p>
When at last he left her she looked to the
picture of the Sacred Heart as if for
approval, and whispered, "Not my will, but
Thine, be done."
</p>

<h3>
XXI
<br />
WORSHIP
</h3>

<p>
A few days later Georgia was discharged
from the hospital with the warning that she
was convalescent, but not cured.  She might
by indiscretion in the ensuing weeks make
herself a semi-invalid for the rest of her life;
she might even bring about an acute relapse,
in which case she would be likely to die.
</p>

<p>
She telephoned the old man that she was
ready to report the following Monday, but
he ordered her to stay away for at least
another week, saying that her place was
absolutely safe and her salary running on.  She
thanked him so earnestly for his kindness
that he was minded to break into her secret,
congratulate her on her engagement, tell her
it was Stevens who had been kind and
generous, but according to his promise he
refrained.  He supposed she would quickly
discover the facts after their marriage anyway.
</p>

<p>
Jim was rodman with the surveying
department of an important landscape
gardening firm.  Sometimes his employment kept
him out in the country for two or three days
at a time, but he turned in ten or twelve
dollars every Saturday night and the family
was more comfortable than it had ever been.
</p>

<p>
Georgia had in fairness to acknowledge
that Jim had shown unexpectedly decent
feeling.  During her fortnight of convalescence
he had assumed no right of proprietorship,
made no demands.  He slept on a
lounge in the front room and never went to
her room without first knocking.  She wished
that things might go on so indefinitely, but
she knew that it was now a question of days,
perhaps of hours, before she must reassume
all the obligations of wifehood.  She was
getting well so rapidly and so evidently that
soon she would have no excuse for not
meeting them.
</p>

<p>
She was grateful to Jim for his courtesy;
and they spoke to each other more kindly
than ever before.  They had ceased to act
upon the theory that it did not much matter
what one said to the other since the other
had to stand it anyway.  She had already
taken over a year out of their lives together
to show that she did not have to stand it.
</p>

<p>
Their example was not without its influence
upon the other members of the family,
Al and Mrs. Talbot, and there was far
less wrangling and friction in the household.
</p>

<p>
Not without hesitating dread Georgia
brought herself to the grilled shutter of
Father Hervey's Gothic confessional box.
She had been derelict in this as in other
obligations; except for her brief and half
delirious words of general contrition in the
hospital, it was her first confession for three
years.
</p>

<p>
Sinking to her knees she whispered, "Bless
me, Father, for I have sinned."
</p>

<p>
She began the prayer of the penitent.  "I
confess to Almighty God, to blessed Mary,
ever Virgin, to blessed Michael, the archangel,
to blessed John the Baptist, to the holy
apostles Peter and Paul, and to all the saints,
that I have sinned exceedingly in thought,
word and deed, through my fault, through my
fault, through my most grievous fault."
</p>

<p>
As she told her secret sins and pettiness
to the priest, it seemed that the poison of
them was being drained from her memory
where they had become encysted.  Her heart
was cleaned and purified and lightened by the
process of the confessional.
</p>

<p>
It is indeed doubtful whether any other
ecclesiastical instrument since the world
began has lifted so much sorrow from mankind.
</p>

<p>
Georgia's conspicuous and mortal sins
were two&mdash;Doubt and her continued
entertainment of that feeling for Mason Stevens
which, since it was unlawful, the Church
denominated Lust.
</p>

<p>
Doubt had followed naturally on absorption
in worldly affairs, dangerous associations and
reading, and neglect of her obligations to the
Church.  Especially reprehensible had been
her frequent attendance at the Sunday
Evening Ethical Club, where the very air was
impregnated with dilute agnosticism.
</p>

<p>
In future she must be more careful in her
choice of reading.  Materialism and atheism
were skillfully concealed in many a so-called
sociological treatise.  Not that sociology lacked
certain elements of truth, but the danger for
untrained minds lay in exaggerating their
importance until they overshadowed greater
truths.  She would do well hereafter to leave
sociology to sociologists.
</p>

<p>
The Sunday Evening Ethical Club was
anathema.  She must not go there again nor
to any similar place where veiled socialism
and anarchy were preached.
</p>

<p>
The confessor was rejoiced that her duty
toward her husband and toward herself, for
the two duties were one, had been so unmistakably
revealed to her.  Did the image of the
other man ever trouble her mind?
</p>

<p>
Yes, Georgia acknowledged it did.
</p>

<p>
That was to be expected, in the beginning.
But it would cease to trouble her before long.
Did this image occur to her often?
</p>

<p>
Yes, she said, it did&mdash;very often, almost
continually.  It was not always actively
before her, she explained, but it seemed never
far away, as if it were just beneath the
surface of her ordinary thoughts.
</p>

<p>
In that case it would be impossible to
absolve her and she would remain in a state of
mortal sin unless she would promise solemnly
to refrain from all further thoughts of that
man, and if ever they arose unbidden to
banish them immediately, as an evil spirit is
cast out from one possessed.
</p>

<p>
The priest waited, but the woman remained
silent.
</p>

<p>
Did she remember, he asked severely, the
words of our Savior, that "he who looketh in
lust, committeth adultery."  If she kept this
idol in her heart, no priest had power to
forgive her sins in His name.  Her choice was
before her, her Lord or her flesh.
</p>

<p>
Her head was bowed, her hands clasped
before her, and she felt tears trickle slowly
upon her knuckles.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I promise, Father," she whispered,
"to try never to think of him any more,
and to put him out of my mind&mdash;when&mdash;the
thought comes&mdash;unbidden."
</p>

<p>
The sincerity of her intention was evident
in the tones of her voice and she was offered
her penance; to be hereafter scrupulous in
her religious observances; to hear one mass
a week besides the Sunday mass for two
months; to say her prayers night and morning
always reverently on her knees, not standing
or in bed; with the addition of five Our
Fathers and Hail Marys night and morning
until her penance was completed; to endeavor
to influence her family to go with her to
Sunday mass each week; and to examine her
conscience daily.
</p>

<p>
The wise and gentle old priest had not been
harsh with her, and she accepted humbly and
gratefully the penance he imposed.
</p>

<p>
He prayed to God to regard her mercifully
and to lead her to eternal life, then raising
his right hand he recited over her the consecrated
syllables of the sacrament, ending with
the solemn words of peace, <i>Ego te absolvo a
peccatis in nomine Patris</i>, here he made the
sign of the cross, <i>et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.
Amen</i>.  (I absolve thee from thy sins in the
name of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Ghost.  Amen.)
</p>

<p>
Georgia left the confessional and went to
the other part of the church to pray for a
clean and strengthened spirit.
</p>

<p>
The Sunday following she went with Jim,
Al and Mrs. Talbot to the cathedral where
pontifical mass was celebrated.  Encrusted
with the accumulated observances of centuries
of faith, it is, perhaps, the most intricate,
aesthetic and impressive religious rite
ever practiced by mankind.
</p>

<p>
From the archbishop seated on his throne,
wearing his two-horned mitre in sign of the
two testaments, his emerald ring as spouse of
the Church, his silken tunic and dalmatic, his
gloves of purity; with his shepherd's crosier
in his hand, his woolen pallium over his
shoulders, bound with three golden pins in memory
of the three nails which fastened Him; from
the archbishop crowned with gold to the least
acolyte in surplice of white to recall His life,
and cassock of black to recall His sorrow, the
hierarchical symbolism is complex, mysterious,
complete, beautiful.
</p>

<p>
When Georgia, genuflecting and signing
herself with holy water, passed through the
cathedral's double doors which prefigure the
two sides of His being, she felt as if she were
coming home again after a long, unhappy
journey.  The clustered shafts of the columns
carried her eyes up to the high, darkened
groins of the roof.  The south sun streamed
in colors through the saints of the windows.
In the east, on the altar, the tall slender
candles burned purely.
</p>

<p>
The incense puffed from the swinging censer,
like smoke, familiar and pleasing to her.
When the priest nine times uttered Kyrie
eleison, the prayer of fallen humanity, she
felt as if a friend were interceding for her
before a great judge.
</p>

<p>
It made her proud to see the slow evolutions
of the choir, regular and disciplined, to
hear as if far away their solemn chants in
stately Latin, to feel that she belonged to
the same fabric of which they were a part.
</p>

<p>
As the service proceeded, the priests
passing back and forth before the altar making
obeisance and kissing its holy stone in ancient
and regular form, the world outside receded
continuously further from the people in the
church, and they became increasingly merged
into one single, splendid act of worship.
</p>

<p>
Holding the jewelled paten with its bread,
above the jewelled chalice with its wine, the
archbishop made three signs of the cross to
commemorate the living hours of the
crucifixion; then moving the paten he made two
signs to signify the separation of His soul
and body.  The altar bell tinkled, a symbol
of the convulsion of nature in that supreme
hour.  A great sigh went through the Church.
</p>

<p>
Upon the altar before them was Christ
Himself.  What had been bread was now
become His real body; what had been wine was
now become His actual blood....  It is
</p>

<br />
KANSAS CITY
</h3>

<p>
Kansas City is growing vain and beautiful.
She has, within recent years, spent ten
million dollars on her looks&mdash;not to increase her
terminal facilities or make her transit rapider&mdash;but
simply and solely on her looks, to clear
up her complexion and improve her figure.
</p>

<p>
Beauty pays dividends to towns, as to
women and gardeners.  Since Kansas City
put in its park and boulevard system for ten
million, adjoining real estate has advanced
twelve, or according to the inhabitants,
fifteen million.
</p>

<p>
Mason Stevens decided he would like to get
transferred to Kansas City, with a raise of
salary.  Then he could pick out a small house
in the trees at the end of one of the new
macadam roads, and eventually go back and
forth in a Panno Six just as he had planned.
He put in a good many odd hours with the
maps and prospectuses of proposed,
suggested or hoped for subdivisions.
</p>

<p>
If he could arrange with Mr. Silverman to
shift him, he would send for Georgia and
they would scout for a lot near a boulevard
end.  The land out there was bound to
appreciate in value as the town built up and the
parkways were still further extended.  He
would like to buy one lot for himself and
another for investment.  He would have to buy
on time, but that's an incentive to a young
business man.
</p>

<p>
He felt confident of Georgia's enchantment
with the project.  The view from the bluffs
was finer than anything one could get in
Chicago for the same money.  Besides the
process of social stratification was not so far
along.  Kansas City was to Chicago as
Chicago to New York, and New York to
London.  Comers-up, like himself and Georgia,
would be more important more quickly in the
smaller city.
</p>

<p>
Mason soon found out that there was not
much to be said against Mr. Plaisted, the
local agent in chief, except that he was getting
old.  In routine matters and methods he was
excellent, but had ceased to be creative.  In
the terminology of a great art, he had lost his wallop.
</p>

<p>
It was the time when the big life companies
were beginning their drive to get business in
block; to insure for one large premium paid
in a lump sum, the entire working force of a
bank or business house.  When the employe
was honorably retired, say at sixty or
sixty-five, after a stipulated number of years of
steady work, he would be pensioned until he
died, which pension might in whole or in part
be continued to his wife if she survived him.
Or he might receive, upon superannuation, an
endowment equaling three years' salary.  If
he died before retirement his relict might
become the beneficiary of an ordinary life
policy.  There were still other plans and
combinations and permutations thereof, whose
details were more or less veiled in a haze of
actuarial figures, but whose broad effects
were alike calculated to incite fidelity in the
employe by holding out to him the prospect
of a comfortable decline if he stuck to his
employer through youth and middle age.
</p>

<p>
Mason quickly reported to Mr. Silverman
that within six months the New England Life
had written two such block policies for
corporations and that three other rival
companies had secured one each, while the
Eastern had obtained none.
</p>

<p>
Silverman telegraphed sharply to Plaisted,
"Why don't you get any corporation business
in bulk!  Our competitors do."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plaisted responded with a laborious
letter of explanation.
</p>

<p>
Then it developed that the New England
Life had things already in shape for a third
big deal&mdash;the Phosphate National Bank.
Mason got the first wind of it, not in Kansas
City, but by a direct tip from Mr. Silverman
in New York, with instructions to investigate
promptly.  Within six hours he was able to
report back that the proposed premium would
exceed five thousand dollars a year, and
furthermore that the Phosphate Trust &amp; Savings,
being controlled by the same parties as
the Phosphate National, was preparing to
follow its lead.  That would make four banks
for the New England in half a year and
greatly increase its already disturbing
prestige.
</p>

<p>
Silverman answered, "Immediately use all
proper methods secure Phosphate business
for us.  We must maintain prestige.
Authorize you act independently Plaisted your
discretion.  Draw on me in reason."
</p>

<p>
Mason drew on him for one thousand dollars,
and obtained two five hundred dollar
bills, one of which, after duly cautious
preliminaries, he handed to the cashier, the other
to the auditor of the Phosphate National.
Again, after duly cautious preliminaries, they
accepted.  These two gentlemen had been
detailed a committee to draw up for the
convenience of the bank's Board of Directors an
analytical syllabus of the differing propositions
offered by the competing insurance companies.
The Eastern Life got the Phosphate
National's business, followed by that of its
subsidiary, the Trust &amp; Savings Bank, and
Mason got Mr. Silverman's congratulations.
</p>

<p>
Two days later Silverman walked unexpectedly
into Plaisted's office.  Plaisted, who
had just that instant signed his name to a
letter addressed to his visitor in New York, was
rattled.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Plaisted," said Mr. Silverman, biting
off the end of a three-for-a-dollar, "I have
found out what is the trouble, that is, the
main trouble with your agency here."
</p>

<p>
Plaisted winced.  He hadn't realized that
there was any trouble, and certainly not any
main trouble with his agency.  "Yes, Mr. Silverman."
</p>

<p>
"You're undermanned."
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes&mdash;perhaps.  I've thought of
breaking in a few new agents this winter."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Silverman, "I mean you're undermanned
at the top.  Weak on the executive
side."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Plaisted.
</p>

<p>
"You need new blood, new ideas, new life,
hustle," he snapped his fingers with each
successive word&mdash;"speed&mdash;force&mdash;energy&mdash;vigor&mdash;
enterprise&mdash;vitality&mdash;dynamics&mdash;do you get me?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;yes&mdash;I'm sure I do," answered
Plaisted, in considerable apprehension.
</p>

<p>
"I suggest therefore that you appoint
young Stevens&mdash;you have met him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Plaisted, who detested
the ground Mason walked on, "I have met
him."
</p>

<p>
"I suggest you appoint him as your first
assistant," remarked Mr. Silverman, calmly
eyeing Plaisted.  "He will take the burden of
details off your shoulders."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;ah&mdash;don't know, Mr. Silverman, if
that would be entirely wise.  You see our
methods&mdash;his and mine&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I have made my suggestion, Mr. Plaisted,"
answered Silverman slowly.  "In
my judgment that would be the best thing
to do."
</p>

<p>
The two men looked at each other until at
last Plaisted dropped his eyes murmuring,
"I will think it over."
</p>

<p>
"I leave at two.  I should like to know
your decision before then."
</p>

<p>
Plaisted yielded by telephone within half
an hour.
</p>

<p>
He wasn't deprived of the corner room; he
would continue to sign <i>General Agent</i> after
his name.  But he realized bitterly that he
had left to him only the shadow of his long
authority.  The substance had passed to the
young stranger.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the following year
Plaisted was granted a six months' leave of
absence with pay, and soon after his return
resigned.  He now travels peevishly from
Palm Beach to Paris and back again in
company with a valet-nurse.
</p>

<p>
Georgia's letter of farewell came in the
afternoon mail, just after Mr. Silverman's
departure.  Mason read it over every night
for a month and found it bad medicine for
sleep.  The lines in his shrewd face deepened
perceptibly.  Finally he locked the letter up
in his safe deposit vault, and seemed to rest
better afterwards.
</p>

<p>
He dickered with the hotel for room and
bath by the year and got thirty-three per cent
off.  He was known by his office force as a
hard man to please.

<br />
THE LAST OF THE OLD MAN
</h3>

<p>
Georgia pressed the knob of the time clock
at fifteen minutes to nine the next morning.
When she opened her locker to hang up her
hat and jacket she discovered a novel which
she had drawn from a circulating library six
weeks before and which had been costing her
two cents a day ever since, a box of linen
collars, an umbrella she thought she had lost,
and a shirt waist done up in paper.
</p>

<p>
She went from the locker hall into the room
of the office, half expecting to find it changed
in some way, but everything was the same.
The same clerks were stoop-shouldered over
the same desks, the same young auditor was
lolling back in his swivel chair, pulling his
stubby mustache, his elbow on the low
mahogany railing that marked him off from his
assistants.  That was how he always began
the day.  At nine precisely he would ring for
a stenographer and dictate from notes.  He
never dictated straight from his head,
probably because his work was so full of figures.
</p>

<p>
Georgia was taken back by the casual way
in which she was greeted.  Several arose and
shook hands and were briefly glad to see her
again; others simply nodded a good morning.
An oldish bookkeeper asked, "Been away,
haven't you?"
</p>

<p>
The girls of the lunch club, however,
welcomed her warmly as they came in one after
the other and found her seated at her old
desk, just outside the old man's door.  But
even they, she felt with a twinge of bitterness,
failed to grasp the stupendousness of
her experience.
</p>

<p>
Since last she had been in the office she
had knocked at the gate of death and lost her
lover and found her faith, yet the people of
the office seemingly perceived no change in
her except that she was pale.
</p>

<p>
All that they knew of her was the surface
and that, she reflected, was all she knew of
them.  Perhaps during her absence the oldest
bookkeeper had received notice to quit at the
end of the year and dreaded to tell his invalid
wife; perhaps he had had a daughter die, not
recover, from typhoid; or his son had gone to
prison or received a hero medal or become a
licensed aviator.
</p>

<p>
The young auditor might be frowning and
pulling his mustache because he had recently
acquired a chorus lady for a stepmother.
The tall, red-puffed girl with the open-work
waist and abrupt curves might, as had been
suspected, be no better than she should be.
It wouldn't surprise Georgia greatly if that
was so.
</p>

<p>
But, she reflected, what of it?  None of
them mattered to her, just as she mattered to
none of them.
</p>

<p>
For everyone she supposed it was much the
same; four or five people one knew and the
rest strangers.
</p>

<p>
She slipped some paper into the machine
to try her fingers.  She wrote hadn't,
"hand't" and stenographer, "stonegrapher."  She
was not pleased to find whoever
had been subbing for her had put a black
ribbon on her machine.  She liked purple
better.
</p>

<p>
Mechanically she pulled at the upper
left-hand drawer where she had kept her note
books and pencils, but it was locked.  And she
didn't have the key.  She had sent it by
Al from the hospital.
</p>

<p>
Miss Gerson walked briskly to the desk.
"Oh," she said, "Miss Connor, you're back."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  How do you do!"  They shook
hands.
</p>

<p>
"That's fine&mdash;you do look a little pale&mdash;we
were all so sorry to hear of your illness.  I've
been your understudy," she gave a little
sigh, "using your desk.  I'm afraid its
cluttered up with my things.  If I'd only known
you were returning to-day I'd have left it
spick and span for you."  She took out the
key and unlocked the master drawer, which
released the others, and removed her
notebook, pencils, erasers, some picture postal
cards, a broken-crystalled lady's watch, an
apple and a book on etiquette.
</p>

<p>
"I think the old man's just fine to work for,
don't you!" she asked as she collected her
belongings.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I do," said Georgia jealously.
"Will you be at the club for lunch to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I will," responded Miss Gerson,
departing.
</p>

<p>
The telephone tinkled on Georgia's desk.
</p>

<p>
"Hello," came the voice, "is this Miss Gerson?"
</p>

<p>
"Did you wish to speak to her personally?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish to speak with Miss Gerson, Mr. Tatton's
secretary."
</p>

<p>
"This is his secretary," said Georgia.
</p>

<p>
"This is St. Luke's hospital," said the
voice.  "Mr. Tatton wants you to take a cab
and come right down here to see him, and
say&mdash;hello&mdash;I'm not through&mdash;bring your
typewriter.  Right away."
</p>

<p>
The old man was propped up in a chair,
fully dressed, when Georgia arrived.  "Oh,
Miss Connor," he said when he saw her, "I
wasn't expecting you.  All the better, though.
Glad you're well again.  I'm not."  He held
his hand to his side and seemed to have
difficulty with his breathing.
</p>

<p>
"Take this," he said.  "Date it and write:
Codicil.  And I hereby declare and publish,
being of sound mind and body, and in the
presence of witnesses, that I do now revoke
and cancel and make of no effect and void, in
whole and in part, the clause numbered
seven&mdash;then put also figure seven in
parenthesis&mdash;in the foregoing instrument, will and
testament of date July second, nineteen
hundred and five.  I expressly withdraw and
withhold all the bequests therein made,
named and stipulated."
</p>

<p>
Georgia took his words directly on the
machine.  A nurse and an interne witnessed
his signature.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said the old man, "take this in
shorthand, to my wife, care Platz &amp; Company,
Bankers, 18 Rue Scribe, Paris, France.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Marion: Except for those three
pleasant days last summer we haven't seen
each other for six years, and as you will
know long before you read this, we shan't
see each other alive again.
</p>

<p>
"I deeply regret that, especially of later
years, our marriage has been so unsuccessful.
I apprehend clearly that the fault lay
with me insofar as I&mdash;quote&mdash;had grown so
very prosy&mdash;end quote&mdash;as you remarked
last summer.
</p>

<p>
"My last wish is that you will bring Elsie
home and keep her here until she marries
some decent American with an occupation.
Underline those last three words, Miss
Connor.  She is now a young woman of seventeen,
and it was evident to me last summer
that her head is fast becoming stuffed with
nonsense.  She is learning to look down on
her country and her countrymen and mark
my words&mdash;underline mark my words, Miss
Connor&mdash;if you encourage her to marry
some foreign scamp she will be very
unhappy.  I know you don't agree with these
views, but I know they are sound, and if you
keep Elsie over there you will live to see
that proved; although I hope not.
</p>

<p>
"Give my love to Elsie and remind her of
her old dad now and then.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Marion.  You and Elsie are
the only women I ever loved.
</p>

<p>
"That's all, Miss Connor.  Now what I
want you to do is this: If I don't come out
of this operation&mdash;appendicitis&mdash;please write
that up and mail it.  Just sign it Fred.  If
I do get well, destroy your notes and don't
send the letter.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you better add a postscript&mdash;P.S. I
am dictating this because I have neither
the time nor the strength to write myself.  I
was attacked suddenly."
</p>

<p>
Two nurses and a doctor who had been
waiting now gathered about the old man,
lifted him gently to the bed and began to
undress him.  He held out his hand.  "Good-bye,
Miss Connor," he said.
</p>

<p>
He died, and Georgia sent the letter to his
wife.

<h3>
XXIV
<br />
THE NEW KING
</h3>

<p>
Samuel Cleever, a tall, thin dyspeptic with
a pince-nez and English intonation, was
moved from Newark, N.J., to succeed the
old man.
</p>

<p>
His first conference with Georgia was brief.
"Good morning, Miss Ah-ah-"
</p>

<p>
"Connor."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so.  Do you understand the Singer
cross-filing reference system?"
</p>

<p>
"I understand cross-indexing and card-catalogues."
</p>

<p>
"The Singer system specifically, do you
know that?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"So I feared."
</p>

<p>
"But I could learn quickly."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so.  But to be frank," said
Mr. Cleever, "I have brought my private
secretary with me from Newark."  New kings
make new courts.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said Georgia in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"I will assign you to the auditing department
for the present."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
She felt many eyes upon her and her cheeks
were burning as she walked down the long
room carrying her business belongings to a
narrow flat-top which the young auditor
pointed out to her.  It was next the inside
wall.
</p>

<p>
The color came to her face in waves as
she passed Miss Gerson's desk and she had a
furious sensation that her habit of blushing
was damnable.  Why, she asked herself
angrily, couldn't she at least appear calm in
unpleasant situations!
</p>

<p>
Her new work was less interesting, more
mechanical.  There were rows on rows of
figures in it, and much technical accounting
jargon.  She ceased to throw in overtime to
the company, quitting sharply each night on
the dot of five thirty.  On pay night she
found, as she had feared, that her salary had
been standardized.  She received the regular
class A stenographer's $15 instead of the
private secretary's $20.
</p>

<p>
On Tuesday of her second week in the
auditing department, Mr. Cleever sent for her.
Hoping devoutly that the new secretary had
sprained his wrist (Mr. Cleever's secretary
was a young man, Mrs. Cleever having been
a stenographer herself), Georgia took her
notebook.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Cleever wanted instead to inform
her that the system of bookkeeping whereof
she was the apparent beneficiary disaccorded
with his notions of system.
</p>

<p>
Since that remark seemed to leave her in
the dark, he tossed across his table to her a
report from the auditor's department which
showed that in the past seven weeks she had
been credited with $140 which had been
debited to Mason Stevens, also that Columbus
Hospital bills for $129.60 (including
extras) had been paid by the company and
charged to Stevens, and that a doctor's
statement for $300 had been settled by the
company and charged to Mr. Silverman's private
fund.  As to the last item, Mr. Cleever
explained he, of course, had nothing to say, but
as to the other two, although he had neither
the desire nor the right to inquire into her
personal affairs or her conduct out of the
office, he must henceforth make it an
undeviating rule not to permit the use of the
company's books to facilitate private
financial transactions between employes.
</p>

<p>
As Mr. Cleever's precise syllables clicked
on, she looked from him to the two page
report in her hand, and back again to him.  Her
lips were partly open and she breathed
through them.
</p>

<p>
When he spoke of his desire not to inquire
into her conduct out of the office, she thought
she distinguished a discreet sneer in his
modulated voice.
</p>

<p>
She knew instantly that it was out of the
question for her to remain in the place.  The
report she held had been typewritten by a
woman in her own department.  It would
spread from her to the other women and then
to the men.  Her engagement to marry Stevens
could never now be announced in explanation.
She would be construed as she herself
had construed the tall, red-headed girl with
the abundant figure.
</p>

<p>
She felt a flood rush over her face, suffusing
it to the roots of her hair.  She saw
that Cleever saw it, and that he took it for
confirmation of his suspicions.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Cleever, I assure you I never knew
anything of this until this moment."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, Miss Connor," he responded
drily.  "Please understand I make no
criticism of the method of my predecessor.  But
in future&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It will stop, Mr. Cleever.  I wish to hand
in my resignation."
</p>

<p>
"We are sorry to lose you, Miss Connor,
but of course if that is your decision&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, it is."
</p>

<p>
He bowed slightly.  "Then at the end of
the week, Saturday?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, Saturday night."
</p>

<p>
He again bowed slightly to signify that it
was understood and that their talk was
ended.
</p>

<p>
She took her lunch hour to write to Mason.
She put many sheets in the machine and
crumpled them into the waste basket in
accomplishing this:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
<i>Dear Mason: I have just learned of your
kindness to me at the hospital.  Thank you
for the thought.</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">
<i>I find that I owe you $269.60, which I will
repay in installments.  I enclose $12 for first
installment.  I regret that I am unable to
pay it all at once.  I am leaving the office.
Please don't write.</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">
<i>Congratulations on your success.</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">
  <i>Sincerely,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Georgia Connor.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She felt as she dropped the note in the
mail chute that Mason was a man to love.
Imagine Jim doing her a great service and
keeping it quiet.  Jim took his affections out
in words and physical embrace.  Jim&mdash;she
caught herself up suddenly.  This wasn't
being resigned, as she had prayed God she
might be.
</p>

<p>
She answered half a dozen want ads
before she could get the upset price she had
determined on&mdash;eighteen dollars.  She
covenanted for this finally with a frowsy
looking, bald little lawyer, in an old-fashioned
five-story, pile-foundationed, gray stone
building on Clark street, put up soon after
the fire.  The windows were seldom washed
and there were two obsolete rope elevators.
</p>

<p>
The little lawyer, Mr. Matthews, had a
large single room in which he sublet
desk-room to a pair of young real-estaters.
Georgia didn't like the looks of the place,
but inasmuch as Mr. Matthews didn't haggle
an instant about her salary, she took it.
</p>

<p>
She had nothing important to do.
Mr. Matthews' mind was fussy and unsystematic.
He had little business and set her to
copying over his briefs of bygone years.
"Codifying," he called it; why she never
knew.
</p>

<p>
She shrewdly suspected she was engaged
rather as a "front" to impress clients than
to work at her trade.
</p>

<p>
Whenever a visitor, whether collector or
suspender peddler, came to see Mr. Matthews,
that attorney bade him sit a few minutes
while he finished up a letter that had
to catch the Twentieth Century or the five
thirty Pennsylvania Limited, as the case
might be.  Then he would fake a letter and
Georgia would help him at the end by
inquiring, "Special delivery, I suppose, sir?"
</p>

<p>
It answered her purpose for the time being,
but she hadn't the vaguest intention of
staying.  She saw there was no future.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Matthews each morning requested her
to oblige the young real-estaters by "helping
them out" with their correspondence.
</p>

<p>
"Helping them out" meant doing it all.
Mr. Matthews was brimming with euphemisms.
Likewise they, the real estaters, got
to asking her to "help out" their friends,
which she good-naturedly did&mdash;in hours.
</p>

<p>
Saturday Mr. Matthews didn't turn up,
nor yet Monday.  Tuesday when Georgia
suggested her payment, he said he was
expecting a check that afternoon.  Thursday,
when she insisted on it, he told her to collect
half from the real-estaters, since she had
been working for them as much as for him.
</p>

<p>
She couldn't see it that way at all.  He
had engaged her.
</p>

<p>
He fell into legal phraseology.  "Qui facit
per alium," or something of the sort; and
she told him nettly she wasn't a fool and that
if he didn't pay her immediately she would
attach his furniture.
</p>

<p>
He turned his pockets inside out, showing
a ten-dollar bill and eighty-five cents.  She
took the bill and walked out.  But it wasn't
much of a triumph.  Her wages during her
employment by Mr. Matthews had averaged
six dollars a week.
</p>

<p>
She was therefore unable to send Mason
another installment; and couldn't help being
relieved because, despite her injunction, he
had written her.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"<i>Dear Mrs. Connor: Please do not hurry
at all in that matter.  Indeed, I would be
pleased to consider it an investment bringing
in 5%, or if you prefer, 6% a year.  If
you pay me $16.18 annually (or $4.18 more
during the balance of the current year), that
would be an advantageous business arrangement
for me.  I hope you may see your way
clear to agreeing to this.</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">

<h3>
XXV
<br />
JIM REËNLISTS
</h3>

<p>
Georgia smiled a little woefully over the
transparent intention of Stevens' letter.  He
was so obviously trying to do her a great
kindness and disguise it as business by his
talk of six per cent.
</p>

<p>
She knew that with young men and small
sums interest rates lose their meaning.
Everybody would rather have a quarter down
than a cent a year forever.  Any young
hustler on a salary would rather have $270
cash than an unsecured promise of $16 annually.
</p>

<p>
Oh, he was naïve and boyish as ever to
think she wouldn't promptly penetrate his
little plan.  She had always seen through his
various tricks and stratagems in regard to
her from the very beginning.  She didn't
remember one time when he had fooled her
successfully.  It was like having a young son
who hardly needs to talk to you at all, you
can read his mind so easily as it runs along
from thing to thing.
</p>

<p>
She went to a newspaper office to answer
one advertisement and insert another.  The
one she answered was for "A rapid
typist&mdash;beginners not wanted.  State name,
experience, age, education."  A blind address was
given.  "Y 672," care of the paper.  She
wrote an appreciative account of her talents,
but was grieved to discover that Y 672 was
none other than the Eastern Life Assurance
Company.  Evidently Mr. Cleever was going
in for many changes.
</p>

<p>
Ten days later she was with a mail order
house, in a huge reënforced concrete block-like
building, just across the river on the
west side.  The roof of this enormous edifice,
according to advertisement, covered 99 acres
of floor space, or some such dimension.  The
firm didn't do a retail business in Chicago,
so everything was rough and ready.  The
clerks worked in their shirt sleeves, usually
blue ones.  They were a bigger, thicker-necked
lot than the downtowners, and freer-tongued
before the women.  She wasn't at
all disconcerted, however, by any amount of
the "damns" and "hells."
</p>

<p>
She was described on the books of the
company as "Stenographer; Class A; Female;
First six months' of employment; salary
$12."  The understanding was that if she
made good she would be promoted, and this
she promised herself to do, but didn't.
</p>

<p>
The advertisement which Georgia put in
the paper was:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
TO RENT&mdash;2667 Pearl Ave., beautiful double
front room, near lake and park; single
gentleman; breakfast if desired;
reasonable.  Connor, third flat.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mrs. Talbot could not be brought to lowering
caste by taking a roomer until Georgia
explained about her debt to Mason.  This
veered the older woman's mind violently
about, and she began immediately to figure
if it wouldn't be possible to squeeze in two
persons instead of one&mdash;which proposition
Georgia promptly vetoed.
</p>

<p>
Jim acquiesced gloomily in the loss of the
front room.  He didn't see why paying
Stevens' interest at six per cent wouldn't
satisfy the nicest sense of honor.  Six per
cent was a good investment for anybody.
Lord knows he wished someone was paying
it to him.  He would feel ashamed to have
a visitor shown back to the dining room
instead of forward to the parlor.
</p>

<p>
Al alone contemplated the subject with
equanimity.  He dismissed it by saying that
it wouldn't get him anything one way or the
other.  To him the parlor meant the place
where the family gathered together after
supper to bore him.  He'd rather sit in a back
room and chin with the crowd across a round,
yellow, slippery table, or go across to Jonas'
and try to win a little beer money at Kelly
pool.  He seldom analyzed his emotions; he
simply knew it was fun to squat down by the
rectangular green cloth table, squint his eye,
and sight his shot, while the crowd watched
him through the cigarette smoke, then to
straighten up decisively as if he had solved
the problem, tip his hat back, whistle through
his teeth, chalk his cue and put the ball in.
Contrariwise it was darned little fun in the
front room after supper.
</p>

<p>
The applicant for lodging with whom
Georgia finally agreed on terms was
Mr. Cyrus Kane, copy reader on an afternoon
newspaper.  He was a widower of forty-five,
quiet, neat and regular pay.  He never once
had a visitor to see him.  He didn't kick.
</p>

<p>
But to balance all these excellent qualities
was one major drawback: his unalterable
condition was that he should be served in bed
with a pot of black coffee at five o'clock each
morning.  He explained he had to be at the
office at six, and that he couldn't stir without
coffee; in fact, he said he was a regular
caffein fiend.  Georgia hesitated, then added
a dollar and a half to her price, which he
accepted, agreeing to pay $5.50 a week.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Talbot paled a trifle when informed
that she had been elected to arise at 4:45
A.M. every day and set Mr. Kane's coffee on
the gas ring until it was hot enough to take
in to him.  But she agreed because she felt
that so she was helping to clear Georgia's
honor.  On the first Sunday morning of this
stay Mrs. Talbot missed the coffee because
she knew that Mr. Kane's paper didn't
publish that day and supposed, or anyway hoped,
that he would sleep late.  At six the whole
family was awakened by his loud mutterings
to himself which percolated through the flat.
</p>

<p>
"They agreed to bring my coffee at five;
they <i>agreed</i>; and here it is near seven and
not a sign of it.  <i>Not</i> a <i>sign</i> of it. &mdash;&mdash;
it.  I'll leave, yes by &mdash;&mdash; I'll leave!"  He
thrashed about furiously in his bed, turning
over and over, and striking the pillow with
clenched fists in his rage.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Talbot, in sack and skirt over her
nightgown, stockingless, her gray hair loose,
went running in to him with his pot of steaming
black dope.  He smiled cherubically when
he saw her.  It was the only trouble they
ever had with him.
</p>

<p>
On Mr. Kane's coming Jim had to clear
out of the front room, so he went to
Georgia's.
</p>

<p>
That evening as she undressed rapidly in
the light before his approving eyes she had
a sudden strange relieved feeling that after
what she had been through in the past few
months a little more wouldn't greatly
matter one way or the other.
</p>

<p>
It would certainly be unpleasant to have
Jim pawing her again, but she had successfully
postponed it much longer than she expected,
so now she had better be philosophical
about it.  As far as she could gather most
women obliged their husbands and not
themselves in the frequency of their embraces.
</p>

<p>
Why, therefore, excite her imagination and
her sense of horror, and try to make a
tremendous hard luck story out of what after
all was a perfectly common and commonplace
situation?  Let her avoid it whenever
possible and accept it with calm equanimity when
necessary.
</p>

<p>
It was rather ridiculous to think herself
a shrinking victim of masculine passion.  She
had borne this man a child, she was scarred
with life, a matron of nearly ten years standing.
</p>

<p>
"And I look every bit of it," she commented
half aloud, as she stood before the
mirror slipping off her corset cover.
</p>

<p>
"What'd you say?" he asked, turning his
eyes toward her.  He was seated on the bed
stooping over, trying to undo a hard knotted
shoe lace with his blunt finger nails.
</p>

<p>
"I said hurry up&mdash;I'm sleepy."
</p>

<p>
"You just bet I will," he answered eagerly.
</p>

<p>
Not long after this domestic readjustment
Jim was smoking, his wife reading and his
mother-in-law sewing in the dining room after
supper when the doorbell rang from the
vestibule below.  Georgia pressed the opener
and admitted Ed Miles, the boss of the ward,
"the big fellow."  She wasn't a bit glad to
see him.  She thought that to keep Jim away
from politics and politicians was the only
way to keep him away from drinking.
</p>

<p>
The big fellow made a formal call.  He
sat on the edge of his chair, his gray derby
hat pushed under it, and constantly
addressed Georgia as ma'am.  Although she
mistrusted him every moment of his visit,
she felt the power of him, the brusque charm
of his vitality, the humor of his laugh.
</p>

<p>
When he rose to go he said good-bye
politely to the women and then to Jim, who
could tell by the pressure of the big fellow's
hand that he wanted a word alone with him.
</p>

<p>
"I'll see you to the door, Ed," said Jim,
and they walked out together.
</p>

<p>
Georgia noticed thankfully that her husband
did not take his hat and that he was
wearing slippers.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to do me a little favor, Jim.
You know we have our ward club election
the first Monday of the new year.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Come around."
</p>

<p>
"I ain't a member of the club any more."
</p>

<p>
"I'll fix that&mdash;and your back dues, too."
</p>

<p>
"I promised my wife to keep out of politics."
</p>

<p>
"I don't blame her either.  You were
going some for a married man.  But the fact
is, they're trying under cover to take the
organization away from us."
</p>

<p>
"I heard there was a little battle on."
</p>

<p>
"It's more than that.  It goes deep.
They've got backing.  Now if my friends
throw me down&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You know damn well I wouldn't throw
you down, Ed."
</p>

<p>
"If you don't come to the front when I
need you, it's the same thing.  And I need
you now.  This is confidential, y'understand?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure."
</p>

<p>
"Because I wouldn't let it get out I was
worried."
</p>

<p>
The two men were standing side by side on
the front stoop in a stream of arc light from
the street lamp.
</p>

<p>
"I want your vote," said Miles, "for old
sake's sake."
</p>

<p>
"I dassen't go into politics regular, Ed."
</p>

<p>
"I don't ask you to."
</p>

<p>
"But I might slip up to the ward meeting
one night, just doing my duty as a citizen."
</p>

<p>
"You're a good fellow, Jim."  There was
a trace of huskiness in the big fellow's bass
voice and Jim felt himself again moved by
his old loyalty to his leader.  The two shook
hands warmly, fervently, with the facile
emotions of politicians.
</p>

<p>
"One thing about me&mdash;I never quit on my
friends when they need me."  There was a
perceptible huskiness in Jim's voice also.
</p>

<p>
"I know it damn well," said the big
fellow, throwing his arm about the other's
shoulder, "because you're a thoroughbred."  He
thrust his hand into his side pocket and
brought forth several dozen large glazed
white cards bearing the legend, "For
President Fortieth Ward Club, Carl Schroeder,"
with an oval half-tone of the fat-faced
candidate.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know's I've got time to make any
canvass, Ed," said Jim, slipping the cards
back and forth through his fingers.  "So
you're running Carl, eh?"
</p>

<p>
The big fellow boomed a laugh.  "You
didn't know it&mdash;Reuben come to town.  Sure
we're running Carl, and he said only this
morning if he could get you with him he'd
walk in."
</p>

<p>
Jim was pleased.  "Did Carl say that,
honest?"
</p>

<p>
"Come on up to the corner and he'll tell
you himself."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't got my hat."
</p>

<p>
"Take mine."  The boss slipped his gray
derby on Jim's head.  It descended to his
ears.  "You're a regular pinhead," exclaimed
the big fellow loudly, and they both
laughed.
</p>

<p>
They walked up to the saloon, Connor's
slippers flapping against the pavement flags
with every step.
</p>

<p>
The saloon welcomed Jim as if he had been
a conquering hero.  It was light and warm
and gay and full of men.
</p>

<p>
Carl Schroeder and Jim went into the
private office and whispered importantly
together for half an hour.  When they came
out, Carl was smiling and announced,
clapping Jim on the back, "This old scout's
brought be the best news in a week.  What'll
you have, boys?"
</p>

<p>
Jim took lithia, explaining he was wagoning,
and they congratulated him and took
whiskey themselves.  He left reasonably
early, half a dozen rounds of lithia having
given him a rather sloppy-weather sensation
within.  Besides, the other fellows had got to
feeling good and were talking to beat the
band, and he just sat there like a bump on a
log without a thing to say.
</p>

<p>
Not that the drinkers seemed particularly
wise or witty, for some of them began to
sound increasingly foolish as he listened to
them, cold sober.  But the liquor put them on
a different plane from him, lower perhaps,
but also wilder, freer, less deliberate and
restrained.  Their thoughts didn't follow the
same sequence as his and he couldn't meet
their minds as they seemed able to meet each
others.  He was self-conscious and glum and
awkward, like a new millionaire in the hands
of his first valet.  And he knew that one drink
of whiskey would alter all that and put him
in right.  But he didn't take it.
</p>

<p>
The big fellow saw him to the door, giving
him a cap that he picked up in the private
office to go home in.
</p>

<p>
"You'll do what you can for the organization
in your precinct?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure."
</p>

<p>
"And we won't forget you."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Ed, that's mighty fine of you."
</p>

<p>
They shook hands; then Jim felt his fingers
closing over a ten-dollar bill which had been
pressed into his palm.  It was easy money,
he thought, as he paddled home in his cap
and slippers.  All he'd have to do to earn it
would be to get around among the neighbors
evenings for a couple or three weeks.
</p>

<p>
When Georgia, who had been waiting up
for him with a peculiar fluttering of the heart
each time that she heard a step on the stairs,
found that he was entirely sober, she kissed
him of her own accord.
</p>

<h3>
XXVI
<br />
EVE
</h3>

<p>
Some six months later, on a hot, sticky
afternoon in July, Georgia came away from a
State Street department store carrying a
paper-wrapped parcel under her arm.  She
had come down town to take advantage of an
odds and ends sale of white goods advertised
that morning.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the heat which beat down from
a cloudless, windless sky and radiated up
from the stone pavements where it had stored
itself, she wore a long bluish-gray pongee
coat.  There were dark rings under her eyes
and she felt ill and dispirited as she waited
at Dearborn and Randolph for a North Clark
Street car, which would drop her a block
nearer her flat than the L would.
</p>

<p>
The car was slow in coming and a crowd of
fifteen or twenty gathered to wait for it.
Most of them were women homeward bound
after the morning's shopping excitement.
One of them also wore a long bluish-gray
coat and Georgia remembered having seen
her at the white goods remnant counter.
They caught each other's eyes and smiled
faintly but did not speak.
</p>

<p>
When the car stopped there was the
customary rush for seats and Georgia had to
content herself with a strap.  She balanced
her bundle against her hip and shifted her
weight uncomfortably from foot to foot
swaying to the motion of the car, envying men.
</p>

<p>
A passenger who looked like an oldish
maid, with gold-rimmed spectacles and
tightly drawn thin hair, half rose and
beckoned to Georgia.
</p>

<p>
"I'm getting out at the next corner," she
said, and sliding across the knees of the
person next to her, gave Georgia a seat next the
window on the shady side.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, thank you very much indeed,"
said Georgia gratefully.  Several blocks later
she turned and saw the maiden lady still
standing on the back platform leaning
against the controller-box and trying to write
something on the back of a paper novel with
a fountain pen.  She had a sudden warm
feeling for this unknown friend who had done
her a small kindness with delicacy.
</p>

<p>
Then, for she was nervously unstable and
the hues and tinges of her emotions followed
each other very rapidly like magic lantern
slides, she became suddenly and deeply
humiliated.  Was she already so noticeable that
strange women, much older than she, would
offer her their seats!  From day to day she
had gone on, still hoping that she was able
to deceive the casual eye.  Henceforth she
felt that she could not by any stretch of will
bring herself to go out of the house except
at night.
</p>

<p>
The car made moving pictures for her as
she looked through the heavy wire grill which
kept people from putting their heads out of
the windows, at the men slowly walking up
and down the hot sidewalk in their shirt
sleeves or stopping to talk under the projecting
awnings of saloons and fruit stores, at
the wrappered women sitting stupidly in the
upper windows of run-down brick buildings
devoted to light housekeeping, at children
sucking hokey-pokey cones or playing ball in
a side street.
</p>

<p>
The children seemed to her the only ones
with joy.  Perhaps that was because they
didn't know what they were up against.
</p>

<p>
The motorman clanged his gong angrily
twenty times, then had to slow down and stop
behind a lumbering coal wagon while the
driver, a much blackened and begrimed
Irishman, climbed leisurely from his seat and
fussed with the neck yokes of his team,
swearing sulkily at the motorman the while.  A
messenger boy got back at him, in the
opinion of the front platform, by hailing him as
Jack Johnson, the hope of the dark race.
The teamster responded with some dirty
language.  It was a bad, hot day for tempers.
</p>

<p>
Georgia had time during the delay to become
interested in a little drama which was
then being enacted directly across the street
from her.  Its impelling power seemed to be
a dead white horse which lay on the soft
sticky asphalt, surrounded by a fringe of men
and boys who stared quietly at a little pool of
blood that came from a round hole above the
animal's eye.
</p>

<p>
The horse's mate stood stolidly in harness,
hitched still to his wagon.  She wondered if
now he would have to pull it home alone.  A
man with a note book pushed through the
crowd.  He was evidently in authority of
some sort.  He asked a little boy something
and the boy turned and pointed toward an
alley entrance cat-a-corner from where he
stood.
</p>

<p>
Then a big man with a whip in his hand, a
leather strap around his waist and a union
button in his cap, probably the driver of the
dead horse, threw his cap on the ground and
stamped his foot, shook his fist at the boy
and turned his back on the man with the note
book and refused to answer his questions.
She couldn't understand it at all.  It seemed
very unreasonable.
</p>

<p>
Then a street car bound the other way
rolled up and came to a stop between her
and the white horse.  Mason Stevens sat on
the seat precisely opposite hers, so near that
they could have shaken hands if the two
grilled iron screens had not been in the way.
She noticed that his jaw fell open, like a dead
person's.
</p>

<p>
She heard her conductor and the other
conductor jerk simultaneously the go-ahead
signals and the cars, quickly getting up speed,
went in different directions.  She did not turn
her head, but she could feel the moment when
he flipped onto the back platform.  Then she
heard him come up the aisle, breathing
heavily from his run.
</p>

<p>
The seat beside her had become vacant and
she had placed her paper package of white
goods on it.  Now she took it into her lap and
crossed her arms over it.  He sat down.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do!" he said.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do?"
</p>

<p>
They both stared straight ahead, not
daring at first to look at each other.
</p>

<p>
"It's&mdash;quite a while since we&mdash;saw each
other," she ventured after a long pause.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, quite a while, but&mdash;" he stopped.
</p>

<p>
"But what!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."
</p>

<p>
Then Georgia, first to regain control of
herself, laughed, breaking the tension.
"What are you doing here!" she asked.
"Where have you come from and where are
you going!"
</p>

<p>
"I got in from New York this morning and
I'm going home&mdash;that is, to Kansas City, this
evening.  Had to see Cleever here."
</p>

<p>
"Is everything going well with you!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that is&mdash;yes."
</p>

<p>
"Business good!"
</p>

<p>
"Fine."
</p>

<p>
"Happy!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes&mdash;are you!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," she said, then added "very."
</p>

<p>
They paused.  "Don't let me keep you if
you have business," she suggested.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't," he answered.
</p>

<p>
He thought that never in his life had he
seen her look so ill, but doubted how to speak
of it.
</p>

<p>
"You got all over your typhoid, of
course," was the way he put it.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, completely."  She read him as
usual, and saw what was in his mind, that
her appearance had shocked him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't look at me that way, Mason,"
she exclaimed suddenly; "I know I've gone
off a lot, but don't rub it in."
</p>

<p>
"You're nothing of the sort.  You are a
bit fagged out, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, "a bit fagged.  Besides,
I'm a staid, settled-down old thing&mdash;and you,
perhaps you're married by this time.  Are
you?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Engaged, then!"  She spoke casually,
but there was a beating at her heart.
</p>

<p>
"Not even that."
</p>

<p>
She pressed the button for the car to stop.
She had a morbid hope that she might still
keep her secret from him.  But when he
helped her off the car and they started to
walk toward her home, she saw it in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You understand now?" she faltered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
They walked a hundred steps in silence.
"Tell me one thing, Georgia," he said, "you
<i>are happy</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered firmly.
</p>

<p>
"That's all I care about."
</p>

<p>
When they reached her door he gave her
the package of white goods which he had been
carrying.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia," he said, as they shook hands
good-bye, "remember this&mdash;if you ever need
me, I'll come."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by that?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean if you ever need me I'll come&mdash;from
anywhere."
</p>

<p>
She looked down at her ungainly figure in
wonderment.  "Surely you don't mean that
now.  I'm&mdash;I'm so ridiculous."
</p>

<p>
His voice choked.  "God bless and keep
you.  God bless and keep you always, my
dearest," he said, then went away.
</p>

<p>
She walked slowly and heavily up to the
third flight, carrying her burden.  When she
opened the door with her latchkey she found
her mother in blue gingham apron, cleaning
Mr. Kane's room.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Talbot paused in her operations.
"Well," she vouchsafed, "Jim has turned
up&mdash;just after you left.  He's asleep in your
room."
</p>

<p>
"Drunk?" asked Georgia.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Mrs. Talbot, emptying
her carpet sweeper.
</p>

XXVII
<br />
THE NAPHTHALINE RIVER
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh, of all tortures<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That torture the worst,<br />
  The terrible, terrible torture of thirst<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the naphthaline river<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Passion accurst.<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Jim was a dipsomaniac, not a villain.  His
vice made no one else so abysmally wretched
as it made himself.
</p>

<p>
After each spree he descended into the deep
hell of remorse.  He thought of pistols,
razors and the lake.  Would not everyone he
cared for be the better for his disappearance?
Was it not decenter to die than to live on, a
reeking beast, a stenchful sewer for whiskey?
</p>

<p>
Then as his long enduring body began once
more patiently to expel the poison he had
thrust into it, he slowly cheered up.  He
wouldn't kill himself, he would swear off
forever and ever, so help him God, amen.
</p>

<p>
In a few days he was completely reassured,
and not a little proud of his evident
self-control.  He bragged of it casually.  He was
Pharisaical.  He pitied drinking men.  "No,"
he would say, raising a deprecating hand
when invited to smile with them, "I've cut it
out for good.  I don't like it, and," laughing,
"it don't like me.  I've had enough in my
day to keep up my batting average for the
rest of my life, and enough is sufficiency.  A
little ginger ale for mine, thank you."
</p>

<p>
And the best of it was that the whiskey
didn't seem to tempt him any more.  It was
almost too easy, this being good.  Nothing
to it, if a fellow simply made up his mind.
</p>

<p>
Old Col. E. E. Morse had certainly
stampeded him the other morning when he was
getting over his headache.  He smiled a trifle
wryly.  Yes, he'd actually gone so far as to
contemplate suicide, which was a great sin,
to avoid getting full, which was a less
one&mdash;and now here he was, never feeling better in
his life and not touching a drop.
</p>

<p>
The old colonel certainly did make a goat
of a fellow.  He had acted more like a boy
than a grown-up man.  The blood curdling
oaths he'd taken with eyes and hands raised
to heaven, by his mother's soul and his hope
of meeting her again.  The memory of his
hysterical state somewhat embarrassed him.
</p>

<p>
Some drank and some didn't; just as
some had blue eyes and some brown.
Bismarck and Grant, for instance, drank.  It
was foolish on the face of it to suppose that
those giants among men were in the habit of
lying awake nights, agonizing over the
question of a glass of beer or two with their
evening meal.  That wouldn't show they were
strong, but weak.
</p>

<p>
At this point he dropped from his vocabulary
the word "drunk," with its essentially
ugly sound, and substituted "loaded," which
is pleasanter, then "jagged," which is
pleasanter still, especially if one humorously
places the accent on the final <i>ed</i>.  A further
alteration in his barroom terminology made
it stewed, soused, plastered, anointed, all lit
up, sprung, ossified.
</p>

<p>
When a periodical gets around again to the
point of calling intoxication by pet names his
next spiflication is not very far ahead of him.
</p>

<p>
In gradually divesting itself of the hideous
and demonic character which he was wont to
ascribe to it in the first moments of his
passionate remorse after a debauch, alcohol
achieved the necessary preliminary work
preparatory to his next one.  The curious
thing was that he always realized in the heat
of a new resolution precisely how the next
attack would presently begin against him.
</p>

<p>
"Never again," he would say to himself,
"never again, Jim Connor, if you're worth
the powder to blow you to hell.  <i>Never again</i>,
understand!  Never mind about George
Washington and Grover Cleveland.  <i>You
quit</i>.  Don't you care if the doctors say it's
a food.  It isn't a food for you.  <i>Leave it
alone or die</i>.  It's been your steady enemy
since you got into long pants.  Hate it."
</p>

<p>
But in spite of efforts that were sometimes
gallant he could not keep his hate hot.
The further he got from his last spree, the
less horrible and more amusing it seemed in
retrospection.
</p>

<p>
The furiously emotional character of his
resolution gradually cooled off and lost its
driving power.
</p>

<p>
Only near the end of a period of abstinence
did alcohol make a direct assault upon his
body, and even then in skillful disguise.
His digestion went back on him.  He would
conscientiously seek to fend off his misery
by pills, powders, salts, extracts, soda and
charcoal tablets, pepsin gum, by giving up
smoking, coffee, dessert, by hot water before
meals and brisk walks; but he adopted these
measures dispiritedly.  A still small voice
had begun to whisper that they wouldn't do
and that only one thing would.
</p>

<p>
If that one thing were taken privately just
before supper, say downtown where the
crowd wasn't around to kid him for seeming
backsliding and if it were immediately
followed by half a teaspoonful of ground coffee
from the receptacle made and provided for
such contingencies, Georgia would be neither
the worse nor the wiser and he would get his
appetite back.
</p>

<p>
"Mind," said the small voice, "<i>just one</i>."  Why
of course, he quickly agreed with himself,
just one.  That was all he needed.  He
didn't want the stuff for its own sake.  He
got no pleasure out of it.  In fact he rather
disliked the taste of it.  But purely and
simply for medicine, as a last resort.  Hadn't
he already tried every other damn thing on
the market?
</p>

<p>
Usually he escaped detection the first day
or two and went to bed at night triumphant
and respectable, his secret locked successfully
in his breast, excitedly convinced that at last
he had learned to drink like a gentleman.
</p>

<p>
Presently he sensed the need of a more
exact definition.  How many drinks did a
gentleman take a day?  Two or three, or even
more on special occasions?  Was getting wet
or cold a special occasion?  What was a
"drink" anyway&mdash;two fingers, three, or a
whiskey-glassful?  How much beer equaled
how much spirits?  Wasn't liquor mixed with
seltzer less harmful to the lining of the
stomach than the same amount taken
straight?  It ought to be, for a highball,
according to test, averaged no more alcohol
than the light wines of France and Italy, and
as was well known, a drunken man was
seldom seen over there.  This being indisputable,
might not one increase one's prescribed
allowance of whiskey if one diluted it
conscientiously?
</p>

<p>
He never tired of these and similar questions.
They fascinated him and centered his
consciousness.  His mind revolved around
the whiskey proposition like a satellite
around its principal.  He might hate, loathe,
abominate whiskey, or pooh-pooh it, or
compromise with it, or succumb to it.  But he
thought of it most of the time, endlessly
readjusting his relations with it, like an old
man in the power of a harlot.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes he would admit that there was
much to be said against the cumulative effect
of a drink every day.  Twenty-four hours
was hardly long enough to get wholly rid of
the last one before you put the next one in
on top of it.  Would it not, possibly, be more
advantageous to one's system, for instance,
to get a slight skate on Saturday night,
nothing serious, a mere jolly, harmless bun,
and cut it out altogether for the rest of the
week, than to go against it daily?  This
suggestion usually presented itself early on
Saturday evening, after he had got a good
start.  After a little argument pro and con,
the pros won.
</p>

<p>
The pros always won without exception,
yet Jim never once neglected to go through
the form of argument.  It was astonishing
with what perfect regularity he repeated
time after time the same mental sequence in
his circlings around whiskey.
</p>

<p>
He did not necessarily lose his job at each
spree.  He was not the explosive type of
drunkard.  He managed sometimes to drag
himself wearily through the motions of work
in the day time, slipping out every hour or
two, on some excuse, to "baby it along."  But
from night to night his drunkenness
would deepen until at last, with his nerves
shattered and money gone, he stumbled home
to his women folk to be nursed, to threaten
suicide, while they telephoned lies to his
employer, to take his solemn pledge, and to
begin his cycle over again.
</p>

<p>
Four times during his wife's second
pregnancy he made the complete circle.
</p>

<p>
She put up with his lapses more humbly
than ever before in their married life.  Each
time that he renewed his pledge her sustaining
hope returned that he would keep it this
time, until at least the baby was born and
she was well enough to return to work.
</p>

<p>
Then she wouldn't be afraid any more.
Disencumbered, her strength restored, she
would be wholly able to take care of herself
and her child.  She could earn two livings.
She knew precisely how to go about it.
There was nothing haphazard in her plans.
Either she would promptly find another first
class secretarial position or else she would
go into business on her own hook, get a small
room about eight feet by eight, at $1.50 or
$1.75 a square foot, in a big office building
and put on the door

<p>
She could see it in her mind's eye.  It
looked fine.  But it was several months off
yet, slow months of discomfort, culminating
in hours of the acutest agony a human being
can suffer and live.  She knew.  She had
been through it once already.
</p>

<p>
But she would never go through it again,
after this time.  Never.  They might say
what they liked about race suicide, this was
the last for her.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime she must keep Jim as
straight as possible and get all she could
out of him.  For presently there would be
some heavy bills to pay.  She kissed and
flattered him, and went through his pockets
at night, racing the bartenders for his money.
Wasn't a business woman a big fool, she
often asked herself, to get in this fix for a
man she didn't love?

<br />
ALBERT TALBOT CONNOR
</h3>

<p>
When her grandson was eight days old,
Mrs. Talbot took him to be baptized.  Georgia,
not yet out of bed, protested against the
precipitancy, but her mother was armored in
shining faith and prevailed.
</p>

<p>
"You know your baby's sickly," she
explained, "and not doing well.  We cannot
afford to take any chances&mdash;in case anything
happened."
</p>

<p>
So she dressed up the mite in his best
white lace, and herself in her best black silk
and sailed off to church in a closed carriage.
He was named Albert Talbot.
</p>

<p>
Until he was brought back to her, Georgia
felt savagely that there was something
ridiculously primitive, something almost
grotesque in the proceeding.  To take her
baby from her, she could hear him crying
all down stairs, to a church a mile away, to
be breathed on by a priest and touched with
spittle and anointed with oil and wetted
with water&mdash;how could such things make her
perfect babe more perfect!
</p>

<p>
Why should this naïve physical rite send
her son to Paradise if he died; and more
especially why should the lack of it bar him
out of Paradise forever?  It was not fair to
put such mighty conditions upon him.  He
was only a baby.
</p>

<p>
When young Albert was returned to her
arms and her breast, she forgot her
grievance.  Anyway, he was on the safe side of
baptism now.  It couldn't do him any harm
and it might do him an eternal and supreme
good.  It was better to take no chances with
the supernatural.
</p>

<p>
She asked the doctor when she could wean
him.  "I am behind in my bills, you know,"
she explained, "especially yours, doctor.
I'd better get to work."
</p>

<p>
"I can't conscientiously advise you to do
anything of the sort," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"But why not?  Most babies are put on a
bottle nowadays."
</p>

<p>
"This one is a delicate little fellow&mdash;not
five pounds at birth.  You want him to get
strong&mdash;mother's milk is the best medicine."
</p>

<p>
"That settles it," she said slowly.  "How
long will it be?  Six months?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, six months anyway, perhaps more&mdash;perhaps
a year.  It depends on how he does.
I won't disguise it from you&mdash;he's worried
me once or twice."
</p>

<p>
A year!  She didn't know a child was ever
nursed a year.  A year more of humbleness
to Jim, of asking money from her brother,
now called big Al, of fear that Mr. Kane
might get annoyed and leave, of contriving
and skimping and bill dodging.  Another
year of "womanly" womanhood, clinging to
males for support.
</p>

<p>
The doctor saw her disappointment.  "It's
your sex' share of the world's work, you
know," he said, "your duty to society."
</p>

<p>
"I have a baby and we're poor.  If I'd
had none, we'd be well off this moment," she
said sharply.  "If I really have done a duty
to society why does society punish me for it?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said the doctor.
</p>

<p>
He came rather frequently to the flat at
this time, partly on the baby's account,
partly on Mrs. Talbot's.
</p>

<p>
The river of life in the elder woman was
becoming sluggish; rheumatism crippled her.
The doctor veiled his explanation.  "Synovial
infusion," he called it, "but," he added
reassuringly, "pericarditis is not in the least
to be apprehended.  I will stake my reputation
on that."  Which gave her new heart.
</p>

<p>
The rivulet of life in the child trickled
uncertainly, obstinately refusing to increase.
"Hmm," he muttered once, "microcephalic."
</p>

<p>
"What does that mean?" Georgia asked
with quick suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"It means that he has a rather small
head," smiled the doctor, "but then he is a
rather small boy."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he is tiny, isn't he?" said the mother
pressing him to her soft, distended breast.
"Little one&mdash;little one of mine."  She looked
at the doctor proudly.  "He knows me," she
said, "don't you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course he does," he answered, and
she knew that nothing else which had ever
been or ever would be really mattered.
</p>

<p>
Whenever the doctor came to the flat he
found time to tarry in the midst of his busy
life of many patients and small fees for a
chat with Georgia.  He was a happy, crinkled,
red faced, blue-gilled little man, who
inevitably suggested outdoors, though he
wasn't there much, for he drove a closed
electric runabout.  He always meant some
day to write a novel, a true novel, something
on the order of "The Old Wives' Tale,"
showing people as they really were.  He
thought he had the necessary information.
He had seen all sorts of folks come and go
for thirty years.  But he never seemed to
get around to the actual writing.  He was so
pressed for time.
</p>

<p>
Georgia Connor, nicely disguised, would
be a good character for his book.  Change
the color of her hair, for instance, put a
couple of inches on her height, make her
something else but a stenographer, say a
cashier&mdash;and neither she nor anybody else
would suspect.  So he had many little talks
with his model, getting material.  Besides,
he liked her.  She was intelligent, she never
bored him and she always had her own point
of view, and half the time an unexpected
one.  She had been twice educated&mdash;first by
the convent and next by the loop.  One could
never tell which side of her was going to
speak next.
</p>

<p>
Eventually one side would prevail.  Which
it would be depended on the baby question.
If she had enough of them tugging at her
skirts she'd revert to type.  He knew.  He'd
seen 'em come and go for thirty years.
Persistent mothers don't aviate.
</p>

<p>
When little Al was a month old, shortly
after midnight on the thirteenth of
November&mdash;she will never forget the day&mdash;Georgia
awoke suddenly as if a pistol had been shot
off by her ear.  The baby was wailing in a
feeble little singsong.  She looked at the
clock.  It wanted half an hour to his feeding
time.
</p>

<p>
She walked slowly up and down the room,
whispering to her son.  Sometimes she
stopped at the open window to look out into
the cool pleasant night, but nothing she knew
how to do made any difference.  He kept
steadily on with his heart-breaking little
singsong wail.
</p>

<p>
At one precisely, before the single stroke
of the small clock had stopped ringing
through the room, she gave him breast.  He
took a little, then gasped and choked and
"spit it up" again.  She waited ten minutes
as she had been instructed, then gave him
a very little&mdash;not more than three or four
swallows.  He rejected it.  After twenty
minutes she tried again.  The warm, white
life-giving fluid ran over his lips and chin,
and trickled down his neck, wetting the
neckband and sleeve of his thin woolen garment.
But he kept a little down she thought.  And
then after awhile a little more.  She did not
wish him to be as far from her as his crib,
so he dozed off in the crook of her elbow,
while she took short naps a few minutes at a
time until dawn.
</p>

<p>
At five she took in Mr. Kane's coffee.  This
duty now accrued to her, because the doctor
had warned Mrs. Talbot not to overdo.
</p>

<p>
When Georgia returned with her empty
tray she dropped into a chair for just a
moment's rest.  An hour later when she
awoke she found little Al lying rigid on the
bed, his small fists clenched, his eyes rolled
up until only the whites could be seen
through his half-closed lids, his under lip
sucked in between his gums.  She was not
sure that he breathed.
</p>

<p>
Hastily she ran to the bathroom and
turned the hot water tap on full.  Hastily
she ran back, and took the child in her arms.
She knocked at the door of big Al's room.
</p>

<p>
"Al," she cried, "Al, Al, Al&mdash;wake up."
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;eh, oh, what?" came a sleepy voice.
</p>

<p>
"Telephone the doctor, quick, quick, quick,
the baby is&mdash;Oh, hurry, Al."
</p>

<p>
She ran to the bathroom and put her hand
in the running stream from the faucet.  Tepid,
only tepid.  Would it never get warm?  If
God ever wanted anything more from her&mdash;in
the way of belief or devotion&mdash;let Him
make this water hot, now, on the instant.
</p>

<p>
Her wet hand and her dry one moved
rapidly together at her baby's clothes,
unpinning the safety pins.  Even in her haste
she put them in her mouth mechanically, one
after another.  Once more she plunged her
hand into the water.  Warmer now, yes,
almost warm enough.  She put the round
rubber stopper in the escape.
</p>

<p>
She lowered the stiff and naked little child
into the tub, one hand behind his neck, the
other held to shelter his face from the spray
of the hot water which was pouring from the
open tap.
</p>

<p>
Al stood at the door in bare feet, his
trousers slipped on over his nightshirt.
</p>

<p>
"D'you want the doctor to come right
away?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say you haven't gone
yet?" she said piteously without turning her
head as she knelt by the bathtub, "of course,
right away&mdash;now, this instant."
</p>

<p>
The young fellow departed on the run for
the janitor's telephone in the basement.
</p>

<p>
The water had become quite hot, but still
the child did not relax.  Georgia tried to undo
one tiny fist with her forefinger, but she felt
with agony of heart that it would not
unclench easily.  She sensed a touch on her
shoulder, then saw another older hand put
in the water behind the child's head.
</p>

<p>
"No, mother, you shan't," she said, "it is
my baby, leave him to me."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I ask Father Hervey to come?"
said Mrs. Talbot.
</p>

<p>
Georgia was too intent to answer.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Talbot walked slowly down stairs,
stiff with rheumatism.  She met Al coming
up, four steps at a time.
</p>

<p>
"How is he?" he shouted as he passed.
She turned to explain, but he vanished out
of sight around the turn at the landing, not
waiting for an answer.
</p>

<p>
When she got Father Hervey on the telephone
he asked if she was speaking of the
young child he had baptized a month or so
back.
</p>

<p>
"Three weeks come Tuesday," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, then he has been baptized.  That, at
least, is well."
</p>

<p>
"But Father, if you could come, and pray,
maybe it would save his life here, too."
</p>

<p>
He hesitated but a moment.  Truly there
was no priestly obligation to visit sick
infants who had already been baptized,
whenever their grandparents became excited.  To
baptize dying babies or to administer the last
rites to those who had reached the age of
reason was his duty.  This was not.  But if
he did it, it would be an act of human kindness.
</p>

<p>
"I will come," he said over the wire, "at once."
</p>

<br />
THE DOCTOR TALKS
</h3>

<p>
When the doctor arrived the convulsion
had passed.  Little Al was lying in his crib,
asleep, breathing easily, the snarls in his
nerves unravelled.  Georgia explained what
had happened.
</p>

<p>
"You did just the right thing," said the
physician.
</p>

<p>
"Doctor," she asked slowly, "will he ever
be well?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by well?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean, when he grows up will he be as
strong&mdash;and&mdash;and bright as other men?"
</p>

<p>
"That is impossible to answer, Mrs. Connor,
without the gift of prophecy."
</p>

<p>
"Don't put me off," said she staring at
him, "tell me the truth.  I have a right to
know."
</p>

<p>
"I should first have to have a little more
definite knowledge of his antecedents, his
family history.  Is there anything which
might explain&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not on our side of the family," Mrs. Talbot
interrupted quickly, "they're clean people,
every one."
</p>

<p>
"His father," said Georgia, "is a drunkard
and the son of a drunkard."
</p>

<p>
"In that case it is possible, mind you I
only say possible, that he has inherited a&mdash;a
nervous tendency."
</p>

<p>
"Inherited, ah, I knew.  There was something
in me that warned me steadily not to
go back to him.  Something that made me
shudder to think of it.  But at last I gave in,
because everyone in the world seemed in a
conspiracy to make me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," the doctor answered drily, "we
run into such histories frequently."
</p>

<p>
"But," she pleaded suppliantly, as if he
had the power to do or undo, "surely my
baby can grow out of this&mdash;nervous tendency.
Tell me he can grow out of it.  With the right
care and training, surely he can grow out
of it."
</p>

<p>
He placed his hand on her shoulder, and
honesty seemed to her to be patent and
apparent in his voice.  "Yes," he said, "it is
possible, it is probable.  I have seen many a
mother make her child over with love."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that's all I want," she gave a happy
little sigh, "for I can do what they have
done."
</p>

<p>
There was a tap at the door.  Mrs. Talbot
opened it and Father Hervey came in.
"Oh," she said, "Father, the baby's well
again.  I shouldn't have bothered you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad for once it's an occasion for
rejoicing," he said quietly.  "Good morning,
doctor."
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Father.  Was the poor
fellow long after I left?"
</p>

<p>
"About half an hour."
</p>

<p>
"Were you at a deathbed last night, you
two?" asked Georgia.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Georgia, we were," said the priest.
</p>

<p>
"It seems somehow strange," she pondered,
"that you two, so different, should be
called together at the end."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it happens often enough," explained
the doctor.  "Poor people.  They want to
keep them here a little longer, and the priest
to bid them Godspeed in case they've got to go."
</p>

<p>
"It must be terrible," reflected Mrs. Talbot,
"to die without a priest."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered the doctor, "Catholics
have the best of us there.  They always go
hopefully, and they're the only ones that do.
I've sometimes wished that I could accept the
faith, but&mdash;" he shook his head slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Why can't you?" said Georgia quickly.
Father Hervey smiled.  He and the doctor
were trusted friends.  There was no
poaching on each other's preserves.
</p>

<p>
"Do you honestly believe in a future life?"
she asked again, staring at the man of science
with her peculiar little wide-eyed stare.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I believe all of us here will probably
have it&mdash;except perhaps Father Hervey."
</p>

<p>
"Well, doctor," said Mrs. Talbot most
indignantly, "I must say you've no call to be
disrespectful.  If any of us is certain to have
it, it's him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's one of his little jokes," he
said, "he means the rest of you'll likely leave
children behind you to be carrying your
living eyes and nose and mouth about the earth
long after the headstones are atop of
you&mdash;and that's denied me."
</p>

<p>
"If they'd been denied me," its chronic
undertone of humor momentarily leaving the
doctor's voice, "or were taken now&mdash;I'd just
as soon quit.  I've four; one's learning to
crawl, one to walk, one to read and the
oldest," he made a vain effort to conceal his
pride in such a son, "Oh&mdash;he's a boy.  He
can work his mother as easy as grease with a
sore throat story whenever he wants to stay
out of school.  Pretty clever, eh, with a doctor
right in the family?  He'll be a great bunco
steerer&mdash;or a great lawyer&mdash;some day and
make his name&mdash;he's a junior&mdash;bristle in the
headlines of 1950.  That's the real life after
death&mdash;our blood lives on, we don't."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Georgia tenderly glancing at
the crib, "our blood lives on, it lives on."
</p>

<p>
"When a little shop girl takes the boat over
to St. Joe," said the medical man, folding his
arms, well started on his favorite eugenics,
"she may be preparing a blend that will
endure as long as the race&mdash;ten thousand or
one hundred thousand years, while any of
the descendants are alive.  Marriage&mdash;true
marriage, where children grow up and beget
others&mdash;outlasts death by centuries, perhaps
eons."  He paused to let it sink in.  "Whatever
else there may be in addition," he said,
bowing slightly in the direction of the priest,
"this much is certain true&mdash;in our children
we find immortality."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Georgia softly, looking at the
crib where lay her child, "in our children
there is immortality.  My sweet little lamb,"
she whispered, going to her child, "my
sweet&mdash;" her voice changed suddenly, growing
very harsh.  "Doctor," she said, "come here."
</p>

<p>
The doctor placed his ear to the child's
heart, then took his stethoscope from his
satchel to listen for the least fluttering.  He
heard none.  As he straightened up again,
she saw his answer in his face.
</p>

<p>
"Is&mdash;he&mdash;dead!" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."  He spoke to the priest.  "I will
come this afternoon, in case I can be of any
use," he whispered, and quietly withdrew.
</p>

<p>
The priest sprinkled the small dead body
with holy water.  Mrs. Talbot and Al fell on
their knees, but Georgia stood.  She was
unable to kneel to a God who had done that.
The priest prayed, half murmuring.  Then in
a louder voice he said, "As for me, Thou hast
received me because of mine innocence."
</p>

<p>
"And hast set me before Thy face forever,"
muttered Mrs. Talbot, who knew the
response.  Al was silent, for he was not sure
of the words.  Georgia stood dumb, watching
her child with her wide-eyed little stare.
</p>

<p>
"The Lord be with thee&mdash;" came the deep
musical voice of the priest.
</p>

<p>
"And with thy spirit," muttered Mrs. Talbot.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of silence, then came
a knock at the door.  It was repeated twice,
imperatively.
</p>

<p>
Then the door was opened from outside
and Carl Schroeder, president of the Fortieth
Ward Club, entered, half carrying and half
guiding Jim Connor, who was stupidly drunk.
</p>

<p>
Schroeder placed Jim in a chair and
quickly slunk out.  Jim swayed an instant in
the chair, trying to hold his balance, then fell
forward out of it.  His hand struck the crib
as he lay inert, unknowing, obscene.
</p>

<p>
Georgia looked at him for an instant, she
began to giggle, to laugh.  Her laughter grew
louder and louder.  It came in waves, each
wilder and higher than the last.

XXX
<br />
FRANKLAND &amp; CONNOR
</h3>

<p>
Georgia and Jim Connor parted at the
cemetery gate after the burial of their son.
They have not, since then, seen each other.
</p>

<p>
Exclusive of her debt to Stevens, Georgia
owed more than two hundred dollars, nearly
half of which was for the funeral.  Mrs. Talbot
had ordered eight carriages.
</p>

<p>
Big Al behaved very well, turning in
everything beyond carfare and lunch money for
several weeks.  Then he relaxed to the extent
of five bright neckties and a pair of pointed
patent leathers.  But on the whole he was a
very good boy, and Georgia told him so.
</p>

<p>
Her own wardrobe was in no condition for
effective job-hunting.  "Old faithful," the
tan suit, once the pride of her heart and the
queen of her closet, had dated beyond hope.
Time had robbed the tan, not so much of
substance as of essence, of smartness and
caste.
</p>

<p>
The models of Paris hadn't worn a six
yard pleated skirt for three years.  So
Georgia couldn't either, without proclaiming
to her kind that she was either green or
broke.
</p>

<p>
As for the blue serge, that was out of the
question too, because it was simply worn out.
She bought a black broadcloth coat and skirt
that fitted wonderfully, as if they had been
made for her, and a half dozen ruffled shirt
waists.  To these she added a severe black
toque and low laced shoes.  The total outlay
ran to eighty-five dollars, but she considered
it essentially a business investment, as no
doubt it was.
</p>

<p>
She was pale, and her face had grown thin,
which made her big eyes seem bigger.  Her
heavy black hair worn low on her forehead
accentuated her pallor.  She was what is
frequently termed "interesting looking."  At all
events many people on the street were
interested enough to turn and look again.
</p>

<p>
She clung to the idea of an office of her own
some day, but because of the impracticability
of starting business with a capital of five
hundred dollars less than nothing, concluded
to begin as assistant to some already
established stenographer.  Thus, she could learn
the game, make acquaintances, get a following.
Then when it was time to take the
plunge, it would be simple enough to circularize
this trade and switch at least part of
it over to herself from her former employer.
</p>

<p>
She went up and down in many elevators
and through many ground-glass doors in her
hunt for work.  One prosperous-looking,
buxom, extreme blonde of thirty-eight,
dressed a coquettish twenty-five, paid her a
compliment.
</p>

<p>
"Listen," she said in a stage whisper,
motioning to Georgia with a stubby forefinger
to bend her head nearer, "listen.  I wouldn't
hire you for a dollar a week."  She laughed
merrily.  "You're too much of a doll-baby
yourself."
</p>

<p>
Georgia noted that the blonde lady's two
assistants, hammering away in the dark
inside corners of the room, were without
menace, sallow and flat-chested.
</p>

<p>
In a small suite in the newest, highest-rented
building in town, she found three tall,
thin young men, apparently brothers.  They
were all very busy, writing by touch, their
eyes fixed steadily on their notes.  She spoke
to the nearest, but his flying fingers did not
even pause for her.  "No women," he replied succinctly.
</p>

<p>
Many of the public stenographers had no
employes; few more than one.  Georgia found
several places where they had just hired a
girl.  Apparently it was nowhere near so easy
to find a place where they had just fired one.
It was getting discouraging.
</p>

<p>
But her luck turned at the sign of L. Frankland,
room 1241, the Sixth National Building.
1241 had a single narrow window which gave
upon eight hundred others in the tall
rectangular court.  The room was not
strategically desirable because there was another
stenographic office between it and the elevator
bank.  Georgia felt sure she had seen
L. Frankland before, but couldn't just place her.
</p>

<p>
"Do you need help?  I am an expert
stenographer."  That was her formula.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do," came the wholly surprising
answer.  Georgia promptly sat down.
</p>

<p>
"But," continued L. Frankland, "I cannot
afford to pay for it."
</p>

<p>
Georgia rose.  "In that case," she said
stiffly, "good-day."
</p>

<p>
"Why not," suggested L. Frankland, "go
in with me as partner?"
</p>

<p>
"Partner&mdash;that would be fine&mdash;but I
haven't any money."
</p>

<p>
"Neither have I&mdash;and I'll be turned out of
here a week from to-morrow if I haven't
twenty-seven fifty by then.  That's how much
I'm behind."  She smiled cheerfully.  Then
Georgia remembered her.  She was the nice
old maid who had given her the seat in the
car on the day she had met Mason.
</p>

<p>
"What's your rent!"
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-seven fifty."
</p>

<p>
"What arrangements do you want to make?"
</p>

<p>
"Fifty-fifty on everything."
</p>

<p>
"I'll take a chance," said Georgia, removing
her hat.  "But," she exclaimed, looking
around, "why you've only got one machine&mdash;and
a double keyboard at that.  I'm not used
to them."
</p>

<p>
"We can rent another for a dollar a week&mdash;any
sort you want," L. Frankland suggested
with ready resource.
</p>

<p>
"We can't get it here to-day.  Let's see,
Miss, Miss ah&mdash;what is your name?"  They
told each other.  "Miss Frankland, are you
a fast writer?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she answered, composedly rattling
off a few test lines&mdash;"Now is the time for all
good men to come to the aid of their party."  It
was true enough.  She was slow.
</p>

<p>
"How much work do you get?"
</p>

<p>
"Four ten-cent letters and a short brief
this morning.  That's all to-day."
</p>

<p>
"What's the idea now&mdash;wait?" asked
Georgia, taking off her coat and leaning
against the solitary desk.
</p>

<p>
"Yep&mdash;like young lawyers."
</p>

<p>
"No use our both waiting with one machine
between us.  I tell you what&mdash;you go over
to the Standard Company, on Wabash Avenue,
and order a number four sent here, then
traipse around to some other public offices&mdash;you
can find plenty in the back of the telephone
book&mdash;and see if they won't sublet us
some of their work at half rates.  I'll hold
down the place, and get the hang of this
keyboard while you're gone."
</p>

<p>
L. Frankland saluted.  "Aye, aye, ma'am,"
said she.  "I likewise do now promote you to
be captain of this brig."
</p>

<p>
When she returned she brought a sheaf, the
manuscript of a drama.
</p>

<p>
Georgia knocked it out in twenty-four
hours, in triplicate, and took it back to the
firm of origin in the Opera House Block.
"Z. &amp; Z.&mdash;Theatrical Typists" was the sign
on the door.
</p>

<p>
The room was small, and thick with smoke.
There must have been a dozen men in it, all
important-looking.  Mr. Zingmeister, the
senior partner, a fat young Hebrew, received
Georgia's work.
</p>

<p>
"Rotten," he said, glancing through it.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" she asked sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Wrong spacing.  A script plays a minute
to the page if typed right.  How could anyone
tell how long this would play?"  He held it
up between two fingers, contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"Give me a sample act for a guide and I'll
do it over for nothing."
</p>

<p>
He hesitated.  "Too many novices in this
profession already," he grumbled.
</p>

<p>
"My time's up," said she, reaching for her
work.  "If you don't want to pay me for it,
I'll take it back."
</p>

<p>
He laid his hand on it.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come," said she, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, keep your shirt on while I think it
over," he answered.  "All right, do it over
again and do it right," he sighed plaintively,
"and space it this way.  Speeches solid.  Drop
two for character's name.  Capitalize them&mdash;caps,
understand?&mdash;with red underlines.  Also
red underline the business, so."
</p>

<p>
He demonstrated with a spoiled page from
the waste basket.
</p>

<p>
"That'll give you the code, understand,"
he concluded, shoving it in her hand.  "Now
shake a foot."
</p>

<p>
The important-looking beings in the room
apparently neither saw nor heard.  Save for
the clouds of smoke that issued from them
they might have been graven.
</p>

<p>
When she got back to 1241 she was bursting
with an idea.
</p>

<p>
"How long does your lease run, Miss
Frankland?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Until May first."
</p>

<p>
"You can't get out of it!"
</p>

<p>
"No, I signed up."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if we don't pay our rent they'll put
us out."  It proved to be a prophecy.
</p>

<p>
Frankland &amp; Connor found a bigger room
for sixteen a month in the theatrical district,
which for some unexplained reason converges
from three sides upon the Court House.  They
described themselves as "experts in theatrical
work," and presently they were.
</p>

<p>
They learned to give a dramatic criticism
with each receipted bill.  The play they had
just transcribed was deeply moving, especially
in the big scene, or one long roar, sure-fire.
Playwrights were as thick as July blackberries
and the firm prospered.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally Georgia sat up most of the
night with a scared author and an impatient
stage director, altering the script of a play
after it had flivvered on the opening, and
getting out new parts for it.
</p>

<p>
At first, she and L. Frankland found themselves
forced into overtime almost every evening,
because the theatrical people were invariably
in such a raging hurry to get their work
done, vast enterprises apparently hanging
upon the rapid, if not the immediate,
completion thereof.  With growing experience,
however, the firm learned to promise impossibilities
for the sake of peace, but not to attempt
them.
</p>

<p>
When the orders came in faster than they
could handle them, Frankland &amp; Connor
jobbed them out again at fifty per cent.
Georgia had three or four private stenographers
on her list who were glad to pick up a little
pin money on their employers' machines
after hours.  Perhaps in hours, too.  She
didn't know or care.
</p>

<p>
At the end of a twelvemonth she had paid
off her debts, except the one to Mason, on
which she sent interest.
</p>

<p>
She was also able to employ a woman to
help her mother with the housework two
afternoons a week.
</p>

<p>
Early in the firm's second year of existence,
L. Frankland came in one Monday morning
with a long face, a rare thing for her.
</p>

<p>
"I want to make a change," she said, "I'm
not satisfied.  I've been thinking it over.  This
isn't an impulse."
</p>

<p>
"A change?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
Georgia was genuinely distressed, because
she had grown very fond of Miss Frankland.
There was no more cheerful person in the
world, she thought, than this dry, twinkling
old maid.  And she had hoped her feeling was
returned.  Real friendships were too rare to
be tossed away so suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not satisfied," repeated L. Frankland,
"because the present deal between us isn't
fair.  You've pulled the big half of the load
ever since we started&mdash;so, give me a third
interest instead of a half&mdash;I'd be better pleased,
honest Injun, hope to die."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, shut up, Frank, and get to work.  I've
no time for foolishness," responded Georgia,
much relieved.  "Fifty-fifty it started and
fifty-fifty it sticks."
</p>

<p>
Which it did.
</p>

<h3>
XXXI
<br />
THE STODGY MAN
</h3>

<p>
Mrs. Talbot was beginning to break.  Her
bones ached barometrically before rain; she
noticed that after she had been on her feet
a great deal, on cleaning days for instance,
her ankles began to puff.  Also she learned
to avoid short breath by taking the stairs
more easily.  Sometimes she grew dizzy and
little black specks floated before her eyes.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately she regarded her symptoms
as a series of disconnected, unrelated
phenomena.  The heart was one thing, the liver
another, rheumatism a third.  Swollen joints
were still different.  That came from
overdoing.  For different diseases different
remedies.  She took her medicine very
conscientiously, treating her symptoms, not her
annodomini.
</p>

<p>
She thought of her children as young, not
of herself as old.  She wasn't sixty yet, just
the time when people learn at last to profit
by experience&mdash;the same age as most of the
people she knew, Mrs. Conway, for instance,
and Mrs. Schweppe, Mrs. Keough and Mrs. Cochrane.
</p>

<p>
The last two had recently been the victims
of a sad and striking coincidence.  They had
lost their husbands within twenty-four hours
of each other, in the preceding February, on
the seventh and eighth of the month as
Mrs. Talbot recalled it, anyway it was of a
Tuesday and Wednesday.  Dan Keough, to be
sure, had been ailing some time, but it would
have been a day's journey to find a heartier
looking man than Jerry Cochrane, up to the
very day he came home coughing.  And a
week after, they laid him out.
</p>

<p>
They say a green Christmas makes a fat
churchyard, and goodness knows last
winter proved it.  It had been very wet and
sloppy, hardly any snow at all until January,
and then it didn't last long.  She had
followed the hearse to Calvary one, two, three,
four times in a twelvemonth.  The climate
had lately changed for the worse.  She could
remember when all the Christmases were
white and didn't use to kill people.
</p>

<p>
The first time that Georgia suggested
giving up housekeeping, mama vehemently
repudiated the idea.  The third time she agreed
to it, but on one sole condition, namely, that
the change was to be only temporary.  They
were to take another flat as soon as she got
to feeling more like herself again.
</p>

<p>
The family moved to the parlor floor of a
long and narrow gray block house farther
north.  What had been designed, in 1880, for
the front parlor was now the living room of
the suite.  Georgia put a piano in it, and Al
a rack of bulldog pipes and a row of steins,
like college men.  The back parlor became
Mrs. Talbot's room, the dining room
Georgia's, and Al took the small one in the
rear, overlooking the back yard.
</p>

<p>
The meals were served, 7 to 8:30, 1 to 2,
6 to 7, in the half-basement immediately
under the front parlor.  They were
standardized&mdash;corned beef Thursday, fish Friday,
roast beef Saturday, chicken Sunday.
Mrs. Talbot and her children had their own private
table, and they gave her the best seat with
her back to the window, as titular head of the
family.  They had an arrangement that the
young folks were never to be away from
supper at the same time and leave mama alone.
</p>

<p>
Georgia saw no reason why she should not
now and then accept an invitation from some
man or other to dine and go to the theatre,
provided she had sized him up for a decent
sort.  She always made the condition, though,
that she would provide the theatre seats,
which she usually managed to do
inexpensively, owing to her acquaintance with
advance men and agents in a rush to get
their Sunday flimsies written.
</p>

<p>
At intervals she received an avowal which
flattered her sufficiently, if made well.  And
she had plenty of hints that she might evoke
a declaration without any serious difficulty.
</p>

<p>
But she had very little trouble in keeping
men where she wanted them, for she had the
faculty of knowing what they were going to
think before they thought it.
</p>

<p>
A young, pink-cheeked, country lawyer
lately moved in from Iowa, and famous there
as a stump orator, gave her the biggest
surprise.  She liked him; she appreciated he had
real brains.  But on the very first evening
that they ever went anywhere together, when
he was driving her home from the play, he
became suddenly and violently obsessed with
the idea that a taxicab was liberty hall.
After a few seconds' struggle, she rapped on
the window, made the chauffeur stop, and
went home in the car after a few pat words
to her host.
</p>

<p>
There came from him next morning by
special messenger sixteen closely and cleverly
written pages, which started with a graceful
and humble expression of contrition and
ended with an offer of marriage.
</p>

<p>
The messenger was to wait an answer.  He
didn't have to wait long.  She at once
accepted the apology and rejected the proposal.
</p>

<p>
She admitted frankly that as a rule she
liked men much better than women (except,
of course, L. Frankland).  They had a bigger
outlook.  But she didn't want and wouldn't
have even the mildest sort of a flirtation.
</p>

<p>
She thought it would be cheap and
cowardly and absurd, after murdering real
love as she had done, to philander across its
grave.
</p>

<p>
When at last she was able to pay back
Mason's loan in full, with accumulated
interest, she was surprised to find how little
happier it made her.  For nearly three years
she had lived with her debt on the assumption
that it was life's most insupportable burden.
Now that it was settled, she began to realize
that she had entertained the angel of success
in disguise.  The debt had been her most
dynamic inspiration.
</p>

<p>
The man she loved had borrowed to lend
to her.  Quite possibly in so doing he had
saved her life.  In return she had broken her
promise to marry him.  Immediately he had
begun to prosper and she to fall on evil days.
Pride could not be more humiliated.  To save
her face before him, it was absolutely
indispensable for her to prosper also in her turn,
by her own will and skill; to pay him off to
the last accumulated mill of interest; to prove
to him that she had done as well without him
as he had done without her; to make him
know that she was very, very happy and
content.
</p>

<p>
When her hopes came true and she
enlarged her quarters and took a third assistant
and opened a checking account, and
alternated Saturdays off with L. Frankland;
when her hopes came true they weren't hopes
any more, but history.  For anyone with the
gambler's instinct, and Georgia had more
than a little of it, yesterday is a dull affair
compared with to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
It gives one a mighty respectable feeling
to have the receiving teller smile and say,
"What&mdash;you&mdash;again?" when you come to his
window.  Then he writes a new total in your
book in purple ink and you peek at it once
or twice on your way back to the office.
</p>

<p>
Yes, success was very sweet and creditable.
It did away with a heap of worry around the
first of the month; any woman is happier
for not having to make last year's suit do;
and people are certainly more polite.
Money's the oil of life.  But it isn't life.
</p>

<p>
If you're only thirty, and the dollar's all
you want, or get&mdash;Georgia leaned back in her
pivot chair and stretched her arms above her
head and yawned, ho-ho-hum, the stodgy
man will get you if you don't watch out.
</p>

<p>
"Frank," she asked, "do you ever feel
like an automaton that's been wound up and
has to keep going till it runs down!"
</p>

<p>
"Sure.  Everybody does, now and then."
</p>

<p>
"But what's the use? what's the answer?"
continued Georgia querulously.
</p>

<p>
L. Frankland looked over her spectacles
and her shoulder, her hands still on the
keyboard.  "The answer," she said vivaciously,
"for a woman is a man; for a man the answer
is a woman.  Whoever made us knew what
he was about, and don't you forget it.  What's
your idea?"
</p>

<p>
"Let's hear yours out first."
</p>

<p>
"Once when I was a young thing," said
L. Frankland, swinging around, "I waited for
an hour in my wedding dress, but&mdash;he never
came.  He was killed on the way to the church
by a runaway horse.  I decided to remain true
to his memory.  I had other chances afterwards,
when I was still a young thing," she
smiled whimsically, "but I refused them.
I'm sorry now."
</p>

<p>
"Frank, you remember my telling you
about that money I owed to the man I&mdash;spoke
about?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And how it worried me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I paid it off last week, and I've
been miserable ever since."
</p>

<p>
"That's because you felt you were snapping
the last thread.  Is he still in love with you?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  At least I don't see how he could
be.  It's been so long, and the last time he
saw me," Georgia laughed unhappily, "I
wasn't very lovely."
</p>

<p>
"If he saw you now, young lady, he'd have
nothing to complain of," was the cheerful
retort.  "By the way, has he sent you a
receipt for the money?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not yet."
</p>

<p>
"The best sign in the world," said
L. Frankland, slapping her knee excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because it shows he's thinking about it.
It's not routine to him.  Georgia, if you have
another chance given you, don't be afraid to
take life in your own hands," the old maid
said gently, "if you know that you love him."
</p>

<p>
"I have always known that, since the
beginning," the young woman answered slowly,
"but even if by a miracle he still&mdash;does, it
is too late now.  I've taken three of the best
years of my life away from him and wasted
them, thrown them away.  You know how
it is with us women.  We have only twenty
years or so when men really want us.  More
than half of mine are gone.  It wouldn't be
fair to go to him now.  He should marry a
young girl.  He is a young man."
</p>

<p>
"You've wasted a lot of time already, and
to make up for it you'll waste the rest.
That's supreme logic.  And yet," with heavy
sarcasm, "man says we can't reason."
</p>

<p>
Georgia smiled at her friend's earnestness.
"Oh, I'm in the rut, Frank.  What's the use
of talking any more about me?  Come on to
lunch.  The girls," she nodded in the
direction of the three employes in the outer
office, "can hold the fort for an hour.  There
isn't much doing."
</p>

<p>
When their meal was finished they matched
for the check, and L. Frankland was stuck.
"Do one thing anyway," she said as she
swept up her change, minus a quarter, "get
your divorce.  Then you can marry him
straight off, if he asks you again&mdash;and you
change your mind.  You wouldn't like to go
through all that rigmarole under his eyes,
while he was standing by, waiting."
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;I guess I won't bother.  What's the
use?  I won't change my mind.  Here I be
and here I stay."
</p>

<p>
"You're a big fool," responded L. Frankland.
"That's what I think."
</p>

XXXII
<br />
REBELLION
</h3>

<p>
Georgia walked home to the boarding house
that evening, as was her custom when the
weather was fair.  It was quite a tramp,
three miles, but then the fresh air and
exercise made one feel so well.  Besides, if one
wants to be sure of staying slim&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Plew, the landlady, was standing on
the front stoop when she arrived, talking
of carving knives to an old-fashioned
scissor-grinding man, the sort who advertise with a
bell and a chant.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Mrs. Connor."
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Mrs. Plew."
</p>

<p>
"Lovely weather we're having."
</p>

<p>
"Yes indeed, isn't it?  My partner&mdash;she
lives in Woodlawn&mdash;saw two robins this
morning.  The buds ought to be out pretty
soon now."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Plew laughed.  "The German bands
are out already.  That's the surest sign I
know.  Oh, Mrs. Connor," Georgia, who was
on the top step turned, "there was a young
man came to see you this afternoon.  He
waited nearly an hour.  He didn't leave his
name."
</p>

<p>
"Did he say anything about coming back?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"And he didn't leave his name?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"What did he look like?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he was tall, blue clothes, black
derby hat.  He had on a blue tie with white
dots.  I don't know as I can describe him
exactly.  It was kind of dark in the hall and
I didn't get a good look at him."
</p>

<p>
Georgia paused with her hand on the knob
of the living room door, as she heard talking
within, her mother's uninflected murmuring
and a musical masculine voice, deeper than
Al's.  It must be Father Hervey, patient
man, who came regularly once a fortnight,
nominally to confer with Mrs. Talbot as to
the activities of the ladies' advisory board
of the children's summer-camp school.  But
his visits were less for the summer school
than for mama, to cheer her in her feeble
loneliness.
</p>

<p>
Georgia slipped back to her own room, by
way of the hall.  An instinct has been growing
in her of recent months to avoid falling
into talk with the priest.  He was so sure
and strong and dominating; and she wanted
to think for herself.
</p>

<p>
Al was whistling loudly in his back little
cubicle, performing sartorial miracles before
his square pine-framed mirror, with a tall
collar that lapped in front and a very
Princeton tie, orange and black, broad
stripes.
</p>

<p>
She smiled reminiscently, regretfully, as
she stood in the shadow and watched his gay
evolutions through the partly opened door.
He had so very much ahead of him that was
behind her.  He had the spring.
</p>

<p>
"Why such splendor?" she asked finally.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I didn't know you were there.  Why,"
he explained, amazed that explanation was
necessary, "to-night is the big night.  Our
Bachelor's Dance.  Don't you remember you
were invited&mdash;as chaperone.  I'm on the
committee."
</p>

<p>
"Hope you have a good time.  Who are
you taking?"
</p>

<p>
He colored defiantly.  "Annie Traeger."
</p>

<p>
"Oh-ho, I thought it was Delia Williamson
that you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It was, but she got too gay, so I thought
I'd teach her a lesson."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Delia," sighed Georgia, mischievously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'll have a dance or two with her,"
Al promised, putting on his coat and giving
his hair a last pat with the tips of his fingers.
He departed with the trill of a mocking bird.
He had been a famous whistler from childhood.
</p>

<p>
Georgia tiptoed to the door of the living
room.  There was no sound.  Father Hervey
must have gone.  She turned the knob and
went in.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, my child," said the priest,
rising courteously and extending his hand.
"I was resting a moment, hoping you might
be home."
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Father.  Thank you so much."
</p>

<p>
"Your mother," he lowered his voice,
"isn't as strong as her friends might hope,
I'm afraid.  She just had a faint spell, and
she's in there now, lying down.  It quite
worried me, Georgia."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sometimes I'm afraid she won't get
better."
</p>

<p>
"She has told me she wished to resign from
the advisory board of our summer school.
That shows how she thinks she is.  You know
how much interest she always took in the
work as long as she was able."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;poor mama."
</p>

<p>
"It would be a great comfort to her if you
would take her place."
</p>

<p>
"Me!" exclaimed Georgia, startled.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  She is very anxious to keep it in
the family, as it were," he explained, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Let's see," asked Georgia slowly, "who's
on that board?"
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Conway."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Conway," she repeated, picking up
a newspaper and writing on the margin.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Keough, Mrs. Schweppe, Mrs. Cochrane."
</p>

<p>
Georgia wrote on the newspaper after each
name.  "And mama," she added.  She
footed the total.  "Those five women
aggregate more than two hundred and fifty years,"
she bitterly exclaimed.  "They're an
advisory board, because they can only advise
about life.  They're past living it.  And
I&mdash;am just thirty.  No, Father, I won't go on
the board&mdash;yet."
</p>

<p>
She was curiously resentful, as if she had
received an insult.  She walked quickly to
the window and threw it open, looking out
and turning her back to the priest until she
might collect herself and control her strange
agitation.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," he answered gently, "I only
hoped that it might please your mother."  He
took his hat in his hand and stood up.
"Before I go," he said, "I think I should tell
you that I have had news from your husband."  He
took a letter from his pocket and
held it out toward her.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;I won't read it, thank you."
</p>

<p>
"He's on a farm in Iowa," the priest said,
"I managed it.  He's been doing hard work&mdash;and
is much better."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he may raise himself up a little, and
then just when people are beginning to hope
for the hundredth time, he'll relapse and&mdash;wallow."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am afraid sometimes he is
hopeless."  The despondency was plain in his
voice.
</p>

<p>
"He's quite hopeless.  He's incurable.
It's a disease; but it works slowly on him,
like leprosy."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think a drunkard is wholly to
blame&mdash;for his malady!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Georgia, "I'm not sure that
anyone's ever to blame for anything.  It
just happens, that's all."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Plew knocked and half opened the
door.  "That young man's back," she said,
"shall I show him in?"  Before Georgia
could answer Stevens came into the room.
</p>

<p>
Without greeting of any kind, in rapid,
mechanical words, as if he had learned his
piece by heart, he explained his abrupt
coming.
</p>

<p>
"I have received a business offer," he
began, "which if I accept will take me away
from America for a term of years.  It is to
superintend, on behalf of Mr. Silverman, the
reorganization of certain life companies
along modern American lines in South
America.  Headquarters, Rio de Janiero,
Brazil.  I have come for your advice, and
your advice will govern.  Shall I or shall I
not accept the offer?"  He stopped abruptly,
looking at her with a harsh, almost savage
expression, as he waited for her reply.
</p>

<p>
"You know what I mean," he burst out.
"Answer me yes or no."
</p>

<p>
"You know Father Hervey, Mr. Stevens,"
she said coolly.
</p>

<p>
"I think I have heard of you before,
Mr. Stevens," the priest bowed slightly.
</p>

<p>
"And I have heard of you," answered the
young man bitterly.  He turned to Georgia.
"Answer me," he repeated, "yes or no."
</p>

<p>
"If it is an advantageous offer from a
business point of view," she said gently, "I
think you should go, Mason."
</p>

<p>
"That settles it," said he between his
teeth.  "You'd made it plain enough with
your silence.  I said I'd come when you sent
for me.  I waited and waited, but you never
sent.  Every single day I've looked in the
mail hoping, and the only thing I got from
you was&mdash;money.  And when I found that
Connor had left you, had been gone a year,
I had a little hope again that&mdash;Oh, Georgia,"
he exclaimed in his wretchedness, "you did
care for me once.  Why did you stop?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't stopped, Mason, but&mdash;" she
motioned toward the priest in his black and
solemn garments, standing beside them like
a stern guardian, "but&mdash;" she said, and her
shoulders seemed to droop forward irresolutely,
"I'm helpless."
</p>

<p>
Stevens took a step toward Father Hervey
and there was almost a threat in his gesture.
"Don't you see," he said, his two fists
clenched, "that if someone in the barroom
had cracked Jim Connor over the head with
a whiskey bottle during his last spree or if
DTs had hit him five per cent harder
afterwards&mdash;I could have her with your
blessing&mdash;and we'd be happy&mdash;oh, so happy as we'd
be, Georgia!  It isn't as if I wanted to break
up a home.  The home's broken up already.
Don't you see?  And you're telling her she
can't move out of the wreck.  She's got to sit
in the rubbish as long as the man who made it
is able to make more."
</p>

<p>
"Young man," the priest answered not
unkindly, "will you listen for a moment to an
old man?  I believe that you are a decent
sort&mdash;that your love for Georgia is honest&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If there is any honesty in me," and Stevens'
voice caught and broke.
</p>

<p>
"Yours, I am afraid," Father Hervey went
on, including them both in his words, "is an
example of those rare and exceptional cases
where at the first sight marriage and divorce
would seem almost permissible&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Stevens interrupted eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"But those cases, too," continued the
priest in his melodious, resonant, trained
voice, "have been thoroughly contemplated
and considered by the deep wisdom of the
Church."  He waited an instant, then
pronounced sentence.
</p>

<p>
"They must be sacrificed for the rest.  For
if a single exception were once made, others
would inevitably follow; and just as a trickle
through a dike becomes a stream, and the
stream a torrent, so whole people would be
inundated in a flood of bestiality.  If Georgia
is, as you say&mdash;in any sense deprived of her
womanhood, it is for the sake of millions on
millions of others, who while the Church can
raise her voice&mdash;and that, my friend, will be
while the world lasts&mdash;shall not be abandoned
in their helplessness."
</p>

<p>
But Stevens, who had not been listening
to the priest's words as soon as he saw what
conclusion they were coming to, clapped his
hands softly together and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I have it," he said, "I have it at last.
I will give Jim Connor a job in the Rio
branch&mdash;with good pay, too&mdash;to drink himself
to death on.  Why not," he asked himself
vehemently, as if he would convince
himself, "that's practical."
</p>

<p>
"It would be murder," the priest spoke in
a voice of horror.
</p>

<p>
"Not by the letter of the law&mdash;and that's
what you're enforcing."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I shall warn him."
</p>

<p>
"My pay will talk louder," said Stevens,
knowing that the drunkard is always on
ticket-of-leave, "and he'll have all the time
off he wants for aguardiente, stronger than
whiskey, and cheaper.  No white man can go
against it for long in that climate."
</p>

<p>
Georgia stood back, fascinated by the duel
of the two men.
</p>

<p>
"You must be mad, Stevens," said the
priest with a note of fear in his voice, as if he
realized that for the first time he was losing
control of the situation.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a grown man.  No other man can
say 'No' to me forever.  If Connor's the one
obstacle to our marriage&mdash;I'll remove it."
</p>

<p>
The two men looked at each other with
steady and increasing anger.
</p>

<p>
The woman laid her hand upon her lover's
shoulder.  "I will get an absolute divorce,
Mason," she said.
</p>

<p>
"What is the meaning of that?" the priest
asked, and his deep voice shook.
</p>

<p>
"I could give you my soul, Father, but
not his, too."
</p>

<p>
Stevens took her hands in his and they
stood together, separated by nearly the
width of the room from the old priest.  He
turned his eyes from them as from an
impious spectacle, and looked upward, his lips
moving silently as if in prayer.  When he
spoke, there was new force in his voice, as
if he had received help and strength.
</p>

<p>
"Georgia," he spoke with conscious
dignity, in the full authority of his office,
"for fifteen hundred years your people
whoever they were, artisans, farmers, lords
and beggars, have belonged to our faith.
The tradition is in your blood.  You cannot
cast it out.  And as you grow older, and your
blood cools, the fifteen hundred years will
speak to you; you will regret your sin
bitterly; and in the end you will leave him or
you will die in fear."
</p>

<p>
"No, Father," she said, slowly as if feeling
for her words.  "It is all much plainer
now.  God is not a secret from the common
people.  He talks to each of us direct, not
roundabout through priests and books and
churches.  He has put His purpose straight
into our natures.  He doesn't deal with us
at second hand.  And I begin to see His
meaning&mdash;He gave us life to live&mdash;and to make
again."
</p>

<p>
"According to His ordinance."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," her answer came quickly and
boldly, "according to his ordinance, written
in the heart of every woman&mdash;that the sin of
sins for her is to live with a man in hate.
When she does that&mdash;street girl or wife&mdash;she's
much the same.  Oh, there's many and
many a degradation blessed by the wedding
ring.  That's against His plan, or why should
He warn us so!  Women&mdash;at least common,
average women like me&mdash;were put here to
love, not just to submit.  If you forbid us to
love in honor, you forbid us to live in honor.
And the life God gave me, I will use and not
refuse."
</p>

<p>
"My child!  If you do not repent in
time&mdash;" the suffering was plain in the old
man's voice.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-346"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-346.jpg" alt="Rebellion." />
<br />
Rebellion.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot repent that I have become myself."
</p>

<p>
"Then," he slowly uttered the inexorable
words, "you cannot receive absolution."
</p>

<p>
"Father," she answered, "the only thing
I am sorry about, and I am sorrier than you
know, is that it will make you, personally so
unhappy!"
</p>

<p>
For a few seconds there was neither
movement nor sound in the room.  Then the old
priest, with trembling hands and bent shoulders,
passed from the room, and forever from
Georgia's sight.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap33"></a></p>

<h3>
XXXIII
<br />
THE APE
</h3>

<p>
Father Hervey went slowly and cautiously
down the front steps, holding to the rail with
his right hand and putting his left foot
forward for each separate step.  He did not
remember being so weary and discouraged
for many years.  He walked back to the
parish house, his head slightly bowed, his
hands clasped behind him, unnoting, or
nodding slightly and in silence to those who
greeted him.
</p>

<p>
Among all the backslidings that he could
remember in his long pastorate there had
been few, perhaps none, that had saddened
him more than this one.  He had grieved for
many a vain and foolish sheep that had
strayed away into the briers of sin, not to be
found again, until, wounded and wasted, it
stumbled home to die.  For such is the
nature of sheep and poor souls.
</p>

<p>
But Georgia's case was not within that
parable.  She was not weak or will-less.  Her
sin had been with cold deliberation, in open,
defiant rebellion against the Church, knowing
the price of what she did.  Very well, let
her pay it.  His old lips drew together in a
thin bloodless line, as in his mind he
condemned her in reprisal for her few years of
rebellious happiness to eternal and infinite
woe.  God was merciful, but also he was just,
and that was justice.  Yet the priest could
not persist in the mood.  Presently, in spite
of himself he softened toward her.  That
she&mdash;the little child whom he had held in his
arms and breathed upon at the baptismal
font, had come at last to this&mdash;
</p>

<p>
It was the age, this wicked age of atheism,
he told himself fiercely, that had corrupted
her.  She could not be altogether, altogether
to blame that the current had been too swift
for her to swim against.  Perhaps the gentle
Savior would yet touch her spirit with His
mercy and guide her at last to the foot of His
throne.
</p>

<p>
Doubt poisoned the very air she breathed;
it broke out like boils and deep sores in the
newspapers and books, symptoms of the
corruption beneath; it was strident in the crass
levity of the talk and slang of the street.  It
could not be escaped.
</p>

<p>
America, save for the Catholic fifteen
million, doubted.  The faithful stood like an
island rising out of the waters of agnosticism.
Was it strange that where the waves
beat hardest, some of the sand was washed
away?
</p>

<p>
Fifty years ago when he was a young man
there had arisen in the world the great
anti-Christ, who had been more harmful than
Luther&mdash;Darwin, the monkey man.  The
Protestant churches, as ever uninspired, had
first fought, then compromised with him.
They tried to swallow and digest Darwinism.
But Darwinism had digested them.  The
anthropoid ape had shaken the throne of
Luther's Jehovan God.  The greater
anti-Christ had consumed the lesser.
</p>

<p>
The Church alone stood firm.  She had
admitted no orang-outangs to her communion
table, and now her policy was justified by its
fruits.  Her faithful remained the only
Christians in Christendom.
</p>

<p>
<i>Ecclesia Depopulata</i>, ran the old prophecy,
the Church deserted.  And the time was near
upon them for the fulfillment of the words.
France, Italy, Portugal, and even Spain, were
in revolution against the Keys of Peter.  The
evil days were coming, <i>Ecclesia Depopulata</i>.
</p>

<p>
But a new age of faith was to follow, so
also it was prophesied.  The deathless Church
could not die.  Once again she was to rule a
pious world in might, majesty, dominion and
power&mdash;and her sway would endure until the
last day.
</p>

<p>
He fell upon his knees in his bare ascetic
study and presently arose refreshed, a
fighting veteran in the army that will make no
peace but a victor's.

XXXIV
<br />
WHICH BEGINS ANOTHER STORY
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
MAKES DIVORCE SPEED RECORD
</p>

<p class="t3">
Judge Peebles Sets New Pace for<br />
Untying Nuptial Knots.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Cupid went down for the count in the
courtroom of Circuit Judge James
M. Peebles when five couples were legally
separated yesterday afternoon between 3
and 4 o'clock&mdash;about ten minutes for each
case.  This is said to establish a new record
in Cook county for rapid-fire divorce.  The
cases, which were uncontested, were as
follows:
</p>

<p class="letter">
Rachel Sieglinde vs. Max Sieglinde;
abandonment.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Harmon A. Darroch vs. Lottie Darroch; infidelity.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Mary Stiles vs. Jonathan Stiles; drunkenness.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Georgia Connor vs. James Connor;
drunkenness.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Sarah Bush vs. Oscar Bush; drunkenness and cruelty.
</p>

<p class="letter">
None of the defendants appearing, the
decrees were entered by default.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Georgia read the item twice and smiled
bitterly.  So her divorce was one of the
"rapid fire" variety!  They said it had taken
ten minutes.  She knew it had taken ten years.
</p>

<p>
And Bush, Darroch, those other people&mdash;might
they not also have walked in Gethsemane?
Was this what the papers meant by
their humorous accounts of "divorce mills"?  She
had received an especially vivid impression
of Mr. Darroch and never would forget
him.  His case had come just before her own.
He had spoken in a nasal, penetrating voice
and she heard plainly every word when he
testified.  He was a short middle-aged man
whose young wife, after ruining him by her
extravagance, had run away with a tall
traveling salesman.  Even after that
Mr. Darroch had offered to forgive her and take
her back.  But she wouldn't come.  Then
finally he divorced her, as the reporter put it,
with record-breaking speed.
</p>

<p>
The day after her decree was granted
Georgia Talbot Connor and Mason Stevens
went by automobile to Crown Point, Indiana,
where, with Albert Talbot and Leila Frankland
as witnesses, they were presently assured
by a justice of the peace that they now
were man and wife.
</p>

<p>
She was compelled to cross the state line
for the ceremony because the laws of Illinois
forbade her remarriage within a year; and
she thought that she had waited long enough,
the state legislature to the contrary notwithstanding.
</p>

<p>
The party of four, when they returned to
Chicago had a bridal dinner in a private
room, with white ribbons and cake.  When
it was finished Georgia kissed L. Frankland
for the second time in their lives.  The first
time was in the automobile on the way back
from Crown Point.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Al," she said to her brother.
"You must come to see us in Kansas City
soon."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed," said Stevens.
</p>

<p>
"I certainly will," promised Al.
</p>

<p>
"And mama," she spoke a little wistfully,
"tell her we'd like her to come too if she
would.  Tell her, Al."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, all right."
</p>

<p>
"I'll send you something every week for
her.  Maybe, I'm not sure, maybe I'll keep
on working."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe you won't," Mason interjected
with conjugal promptitude.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be too sure," she laughed, "and
anyway, if you don't behave nicely I can
always go back to L. Frankland."
</p>

<p>
When the man and his wife were alone in
their room he returned to the moment of
their betrothal.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest," he said, "when the priest went
out and left us&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"I felt almost as if he were trying to lay
a curse on us."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that was the meaning of it."
</p>

<p>
"When he said you couldn't receive absolution."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, our&mdash;their teaching is that without
absolution a soul in sin is damned eternally."
</p>

<p>
"And you will never be afraid?" he asked,
almost fearful of his wonderful new happiness.
</p>

<p>
She pressed her husband's hand against
her breast, so that he felt the strong and
steady beating of her heart.
</p>

<p>
"No," she answered him, "I will never be
afraid.  For I believe that God will
understand everything."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
